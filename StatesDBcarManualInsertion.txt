4;0,1;Squealing can be caused by various problems. Squeals can be the result of worn belts, or in some cases, problems with the brakes. Unless you are familiar with automobiles, it might be hard to diagnose the problem that is causing the noise. If you listen closely to noises you may be able to differentiate between a chirp and a squeal. Chirping is usually a sign of break issues while squealing comes from the engine and might mean a bad belt.;i:2,can:2,hear:2,squeals:1,squeaks:1;i can hear squeals;Null

14;0,0,9;Its a fact of life: Your car will need fresh oil to stay functioning. However, if youre finding its needing changes and top-ups more frequently than it should, there might be a problem. Early signs you need to check your oil include a minor dip in performance and the ever-dreaded oil light on your dashboard. When your car is in a particularly dire need of an oil change, you may even start to see corrosion in its engine. Another oil-related complaint is the clogged oil filter. Youll probably see this problem if youve waited too long to change the oil. While modern cars come with systems that are equipped with filter bypasses, Its a good rule of thumb to change the filter whenever you change the oil. there also might be a leak, to check for a leak, simply park the car on a dry floor, fill the oil tank, let the car run for a few minutes,turn it off, and leave it for the night, if there is a small pool of oil under the car, you have a leak, go to a mechanic to replace the faulty pipe.;the:1,car:1,keeps:1,losing:1,oil:2,excessive:1,consumption:1;the car keeps losing oil excessive oil consumption;Null
15;0,0,9;Corrosion is the typical culprit when it comes to radiator leaks. However, the root cause of corrosion can be anything from poor maintenance to factory defects to contaminated fluid. In general, it makes more sense to replace a radiator rather than patch it up. That first leak means corrosion has already set in and that more leaks will follow soon. Whichever course you decide to take, avoid driving your car before its fixed — A leaky radiator can lead to overheating and even an engine fire.;oil:1,temprature:1,lamp:1,is:1,on:1,or:1,radiator:1,leaks:1;oil temprature lamp is on or radiator leaks;Null
