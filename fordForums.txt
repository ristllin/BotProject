>>>Title||| need ideas on my 68 mustang project car
>>ginhotrod99|||Original question||| Hello im new here about two years ago my old man passed giving me possession of our mustang he had it build for me when I was very little about 7 currently it sat for about 10 years in a garage till he gave it to me to take care of a 4.7 liter v8 about 400 hp its very high in torque it has a c4 3 speed auto that's rebuilt but is pretty banged up from abuse :C It has a holley 2 barrel carb it was very slightly oil starved but had it looked just lost some life in my heads :C suspension too soft bottoms out now I want to learn form people and get ideas on what I should do with her she is a very hot tempered car over heats way too quick run at about 230 to 200 mostly had a thermostat changed and she run now at 190 to 180 on mild hot days scorching at around 230 to 240 she shuts down and refuses to start for about and 1 hour after cooling here is her pictures someone show me how to post pictures? 
>>65comet|||Followup-question||| To post a picture you have to save it to a free picture sharing site then post the link.  I think there is another way, but I haven't done it here in years and can't remember.
If it is the original radiator, or even the second, you have to replace it.  The original just wasn't designed to last this long or for better cooling.  My 65 Comet when it went from a 260 to a 289, the overheating back in 1979 was horrendous and it needed a new one.  I can't give you advice on the suspension. 
>>piston_slap|||Followup-question||| 400HP in a 289 with a 2 bbl carb? Not very likely but you'll need to get the coolant temps down and the radiator replacement that 65Comet is where I'd start too. Rock Auto has a selection of radiators from $105 to $250. Even have a 2 row aluminum for $126 
>>>Title||| Should I Rebuild Carb or get a Fitech EFI system?
>>gz19960101|||Original question||| Hello Everyone, 
  Thanks for check my post. 
  I have a 79 Thunderbird with orginal carb on a 5.0 Ford 302 engine which produce about 130hp, which I am going to rebuild the engine to gain some hp about 220+. But for the carb part, I am enough about those old school stuff that need to adjust every week, or either they will have a insane idle speed about 2000+ when hot, and sometimes almost die at 200-300 when stop at red light. 
  So my  first question, a rebuild on this carb will help me to address those concern? Like high idle, hard cold start, bad smell when morning, bad fuel mileage? Because a rebuild and installation will cost about $300. And also, what about switch to other brand like holley etc.
  And my second question, There are so many aftermarket EFI producer in the market, like FItech, EZ EFI etc, As for my low hp engine about 200hp, I dont think i need a really expensive  EFI  system, which I think i will only need to get a fitech go street 400hp, which I think will be enough for this engine, and it only cost 800. And a new 4 manifold will be 300, and fuel pump etc, which will total cost about 1200-1400, and to consider there are tons of conversion video online, may be i can do it my own, or i need to plus another couple hundred for labor. 
  
  My concern on those EFI system, are they realible? Like for at least 2-3 years i dont need to often adjust or fix them? 
Any ideas? Thanks!!!! 
>>347 ranger|||Answer||| Ford 's old  two barrel carbs  left  a lot to be  desired. a 4 barrel intake manifold and a 
electronic EFI would  be an up grade that  would be worth while!

>>Stealthee</span>|||Original question||| My opinion is people are tired of ugly cars. Ford is seeing a dip in car sales because they dont know how to make a good looking car. Same is true for GM where they cut a bunch of jobs at Lordstown where they produce the Cruze. 
>>65comet|||Followup-question||| Ford man since the day I was born, but other than a Mustang (which they are still going to make) there hasn't been a car I would buy in years.  I'll probably get a new Expedition to replace the old one next. 
>>Mikelangeloford|||Answer||| Ford isn't selling cars for the same reason as Chrysler. Overpriced and under engineered trash. Go to any Pick and Pull the vast majority of their cars are Ford, Dodge, Chrysler and Chevy cars and trucks that didn't last 10 years on the road. People are not going into debt for 7 years on a car that lasts 5. No one is going to miss an underpowered mess with cheap material and cheap seats that cost $25,000. Car companies need to up their game and produce quality, easy to maintain, affordable cars.

>>tomj76|||Answer||| My take it this... I don't see the practical value in owning an SUV or Crossover.  I looked at the Explorer before I purchased my Windstar, but since it only carried five people AND didn't even hold one full sheet of plywood, plus the higher operating costs (due to fuel consumption and tire size, etc.), I saw no value for me to own one.  I haven't looked that much at the Crossovers, but the same logic seems to apply.
I don't see much value in a pickup truck (for me) because I only occasionally need the ability to carry the payload, but more often would like to carry passengers, and they also cost a lot more to operate unless you purchase a small truck.
Add to all this that my experience with purchasing new vehicles from the dealership has not been great, with several defects (not long term wear) in the vehicles that I've purchased.  The only reason I've remained a customer is that I've found that once _I_ fix the problems, the vehicles have been a good value.
I've decided that my needs are best served by a sedan, a wagon, or a minivan.  Since Ford will not be making those products, I will most likely not purchase another (new) Ford unless something changes. 
>>dbegley|||Followup-question||| I was talking to my Ford Sales guy when I purchased my 17 Mustang GT and asked him that question. What is up with Ford making this decision. He said that Ford is not selling enough of those cars to justify being in that business. He added that the Toyota Camry is the best selling car in the US and they don't also don't make enough profit on the sales of that line to justify staying in it. People are buying SUV's and trucks. You do know the BEST selling vehicle in the world is the Ford F-150.

>>>Title||| 2.3 pinto fuel pump
>>resturt|||Original question||| The original pump was replaced and shortly it dripped oil from the bottom. It started as a drop but now it is a lot worse. I plan to put a new one on. The gas always drains down  after sitting a short while. Does a check valve help that problem? Would a check valve also have to be put into the return line? 
>>65comet|||Answer||| I haven't worked on a Pinto in over 35 years, but I don't remember them having a return line.  A bad seal in the pump will cause that oil leak.  Best to go with a new one.  I'd wait on a check valve till after the new pump since a good pump will act as a check valve.

>>>Title||| Need Help ASAP - Mechanics please
>>Valerie0146|||Original question||| Hello, I was driving my 2009 Ford Flex to the mall on Christmas Eve when it felt like my car was pulling a bit when I was driving. If I took my foot off the gas, it would stop by itself without any use of the breaks. Also, I could smell burning when I stopped.  I got to the mall and made sure the e brake wasn’t on so it wasn’t that. I called my brother in law who knows a lot about cars and he said it sounded like one of my calipers had seized. I brought the car to a shop
Today and told them what happened and they told me
That while they were checking they noticed two different fluids in my brake reservoir and said that all 4 of my wheels were seized. Which honestly didn’t make sense to me because I DROVE my car to them and the wheels were turning. Definitely having troubles but not totally seized. There was a strong burning smell by the time I got there I might add. They asked me if I could have added oil to my brake reservoir but it’s not possible. I may be a chick but I can read labels and the only fluids I topped up recently was my washer fluid and my power steering fluid because I have a slight leak but those reservoirs are both on the opposite side of the engine and I have topped them up several times so I know where the fluids are supposed to go. Now they are telling me they are going to have to fix the entire system and quoting me at $3500 to $4000...... I feel like I’m being taken advantage of and I don’t have that kind of money. A lot of other forums I have read the people say that if oil was in the brake reservoir it would make the brake system mush and not seize it up. Can this be something else?? I might also ad that my traction control and abs light comes on and off randomly for the last few months and I was told it was just the sensor. Any insight would seriously help me I just moved to the area from 3 hours away so finding a mechanic I can trust seems really hard.

>>65comet|||Followup-question||| Complete flush of the system, a new caliper if one is needed, all new pads at a quality expensive shop, I would expect to be around $500.  Use the internet to see what customers say about the other shops in the area and try one of them.
ABS sensor problems need to be tracked when the light is on usually.  I have had Fords with a cracked sensor that would trigger the light when water got inside and go off when they would dry out.  The big problem was having it stay tripped until I got a reading to find out which one it was. 
>>Sedanman64|||Followup-question||| If you're still having this problem, have you gotten out of the car and put your hand over each wheel while the problem is happening to see if one is much warmer than the other? I don't know much about late models and what all of the other system components are, but that sounds like a high quote. If one caliper is locking up, replace that one. You'll have to replace the pads on that end of the car, both sides, to make things even, and probably have those two rotors resurfaced and maybe new brake fluid but that should be it. 
Nice Comet, '65Comet! I had early Falcons for years.

>>Sedanman64|||Original question||| Any tips on how to do this? Someone on another forum told me they did it, but haven't told me how. Obsolete Ford dealer part # is F1CZ78247A. Part is a Manual Lever Position Sensor for an automatic overdrive (transverse, not a regular AOD) in a 1994 1.9L Escort.

>>>Title||| Need some advice
>>GeneralESpeaking|||Original question||| Hi everyone. So I work at the auto center at Walmart and I was tasked with transferring an old tire to a spare rim for a Ford. However, while taking the tire off the old rim a little bit of the rubber on the bead got shaved off. I still continued to put it on the spare rim though and now the customer has that tire as their spare. I just need some advice on whether this was a terrible decision or not. If they use that tire is there a possibility of a blowout occurring? Or will it just lose air? I'm thinking that if anything I can try to contact the customer and get them to come back to the shop. My job might be fucked, but I really don't want anyone getting hurt because of me. What do you guys think? 
>>65comet|||Followup-question||| It depends on the size/amount of rubber that was lost and if it included any of the belt material.  If there was no belt lost, it shouldn't fail.  But it will probably leak over time and the customer will have a flat spare when they need a full one.  If you think about someone late at night with a flat on the side of the road in a place without cell service, you wouldn't want to be responsible for them to not have a good spare. 
>>>Title||| 1973 Ford Gran Torino 5.8L 351W
>>Bumbadawg|||Original question||| Hey all,
My name is Joe and I had a few questions about my Gran Torino but didn't see a sub thread for the make. 
So, I have an automatic 1973 Gran Torino. The previous owner repainted it, cut the lower dash to fit a cd player, and put a crappy random steering wheel on it. But I have questions as a newb into diy. 
Let me begin!
1) Can this be modified to a higher amp one-wire alt. I tried before and burned up the wiring harness to the solenoid. Oops. So, can it be done? Cuz 60 amps suck. 
2) I love the original dash but because he cut it to fit a cd player (id go with original radio)--I either need to find the lower replacement, which I cannot find or have a custom dash made to go digital? 
3) It has parts for factory ac but didnt come with it. Any ideas on what id need to get it going?
4) The right side vents squeal like hell when defrost or vents are turned on. Blower motor? Any thoughts?
I know I have asked a ton...but aside from a vague Chilton book...I have nothing and few if any shops in my area will touch it cuz of its age. 
Thanks,
Joe B from NC 
>>65comet|||Answer||| 1.  The wiring isn't rated for higher, so you'd have to put in higher gauge wire to compensate.
2.  '73 wasn't a particularly popular year for Torino.  Finding a replacement dash isn't something I'd want to go after.  I'd probably weld in a patch panel.
3.  The original AC from most '73 would work, but also hard to find.  I'd go with one of those new kits they have for classic cars.  It will be reliable and have replacement/service parts available.
4.  Many a pen/pencil/toy was dropped down the big defrost vents on those cars and caused a fan squeal or two.  I'd open it up and see if it is a foreign object or the blower worn out. 
>>Bumbadawg|||Followup-question||| Wow, thanks for the info and quick response!
Ill look into the higher gauge wiring. Ill also check the blower to see. 
I appreciate all the info. The dash solution isn't ideal but..I understand what you mean about availability or lack thereof of replacement dash options. 
Really appreciate the info.

>>Jk350582016|||Original question||| I have a 1991 f-150 long bed, I believe the fuel pump went out in it. Was wondering how much would a local shop cost in total to replace it labor included. 
>>jasongraygits|||Answer||| It will cost you around $90-95 without labor and $115-120 with labor. 
>>Stealthee</span>|||Answer||| You may be quoting Dubai labor rates, but I can assure you that in the US labor will be more than that.  We did a pump on a similar year F150 a few years back and dropped the tank to do it.  Wasn't fun.  A shop may lift the bed off, but that wasn't an option for us due to space constraints and fear of snapping mount bolts.
Expect to pay a few hours labor for a shop to do it.  Most shops are probably going to charge $60-$80 an hour.  I'd say labor will be in the realm of $200, plus the cost of the pump.  If you have hand tools and time I'd recommend taking a day and doing it yourself.

Hi everyone. Just did a search on this forum for &quot;lightweighting&quot; and the most recent post was this one in 2014 about the 2600 pound lightweight concept car from Ford.
Does anyone have any thoughts on lightweighting in 2017? What's the lightest car you've test-driven lately? Which cars or manufacturers stand out in this aspect? Is safety (as discussed in the comments above) still the biggest challenge?
We're going to be talking about lightweighting at our Knoxville forum next month, so thought we would get some input and crowdsource some thoughts. 
>>JEC Composites|||Followup-question||| Hello all,
Yamaha debuted their super lightweight concept car at the Tokyo Motor Show this year:
&quot;The concept car itself is a small, mid-engined two seater with an unmistakable profile and curves from the front to the rear. Weighing in at only 750kg (about 1,650 pounds), it is not hard to see where Yamaha got their inspiration from (hint: their motorcycles!).&quot;
This article includes the quote, &quot;Light weighting is the final frontier in the automotive industry.&quot;
Interesting as we'll be talking a lot about light weighting at our automotive composites forum this month, Nov 15-16 in Knoxville.
It will be exciting to see the sleek, lightweight cars to come!

>>gotdurt|||Original question||| I have a 2001 E150 van with a &quot;Ford Vehicle Security System&quot;. I've owned it for a few months, and haven't had a need to even think about the alarm; it never caused any problems with entry, starting, etc. I questioned that it even worked, which to me, was a good thing. 
A few days ago, I replaced the clockspring in the steering wheel, and to do so, had to disconnect the battery... after reconnecting the battery, all heck broke loose, and has been a headache ever since. I can't seem to find a rhyme or reason to how this thing works, but now any time I open a door with a key, it goes off. After disarming, which is almost every time I get in it, it won't start; I have to turn the key off, hit the unlock button on the fob a couple of times, then try again. Among other annoyances...
I have located the sensor and module. I also noted a wire that was tapped into a blue or purple (color blind) wire on the clock spring harness. I transferred it to the new wire, but question the need for it.
Frankly, there is no need for an alarm in this van, and I just want the alarm out of my life, or at least seemingly inoperable, like it was before... 
How can I:
a) disconnect it from the door locks AND ignition (ignition at the very least)
or:
b) remove it permanently, while keeping the remote keyless entry

They have had it to the ford dealer numerous times and are always told its the gas cap. This vehicle is not capless and its not flex fuel. When It was here for the last oil change they said they just had it at ford and it needed a new gas cap. I checked and the cap had not been replaced, it looked original and in very bad shape. Customer could not tell me if they had been charged for a new one as its a company account. I visually inspected all the hoses that I could find, checked the vent solenoid and removed the canister to see if it was full of mud, which is common around here. I did replace the gas cap, I figured if ford kept saying it, why not, it was only $30. At present I do not have a smoke machine to test the system, and I made the customer aware of that. But what bothers me is they've had it at ford and were repeatedly told the system had been tested and It was always the gas cap. I know a lot of times with the small leak code the gas cap is checked first, and a lot of times it is said to be loose. I have asked if they leave it running while fueling, but was told no. Are they any common rubbing spots on those evap lines that anyone is aware of, or any really common things in this system? I have strong suspicion it has to do with mud somewhere or damage, really which the shop had a smoke machine, I really don't want to take a wild guess and throw a part at it that it doesn't need.

>>>Title||| Info on Ford Safety Recalls
>>daveinlv|||Original question||| I recently traded in a 2012 Ford Escape for a smaller sedan. When the dealer ran a CarFax on my car, he asked me if I knew there was a recall on the car. I replied I knew, as I'd received a letter over a year ago advising of the recall, then advising to wait for another letter telling me to go to a local dealer to have the work done, and I was still waiting for the second letter. The salesman starts telling me how all he can do is wholesale out the car, and insinuating that he'd have to drastically reduce the trade-in value. We bristled up and prepared to walk out, as the Escape was in immaculate shape with only 28K miles on it (wife's car and she rarely drove it), and we felt it was worth no less than $10K. When saleman realized we were leaving, he worked out a deal where we got the $10K trade-in, and we proceeded with the deal.. 
My question is this: Does a undone safety recall prevent selling a car?? In the case of the Escape, it's kind of moot, as we've traded the car in,  I also have a 2007 Ford Ranger Extra Cab that I want to sell and get a smaller sedan. This vehicle ALSO has an outstanding
&quot;Important Safety Recall&quot; and the letter I have reporting this is dated July 2016, and nothing further from Ford. I tried calling Ford itself and after giving the &quot;engrish&quot; speaking rep the recall #, (16S26), and the VIN number his reply was &quot;just wait for the second letter&quot;... Ummm Hey Ford! Its been a $#%#$$ year... 
Question: Am I going to get screwed selling this truck, or worse, be prevented from selling it because of this unfullfilled recall???
HELP!
Thanks

>>shorod</span>|||Followup-question||| I know of no reason an open recall would effect the resale or trade in value of a vehicle.  Getting the recall implemented would not be a cost to any dealership or purchaser as long as the recall is still listed as Open in the Ford system.  It's a slight inconvenience, but for a large dealership that inconvenience would seem minimal unless they need to move the vehicle to auction right away.  
You should be able to find out what recalls are still open on your vehicle over the Internet.  I'm trying to recall the website.  It's either safercar.gov, nhtsa.gov, or odi.gov (Office of Defects Investigation).  It shouldn't take much Googling to figure it out.
-Rod 
>>Stealthee</span>|||Followup-question||| It was a salesman being a salesman.  As rod pointed out the recall will be of no cost to the dealership. Most of the so called &quot;safety recalls&quot; are half-assed fixes to appease the masses because people are too stupid to properly know how to react to a vehicle.

>>>Title||| Ford Ranger as a first vehicle?
>>klein.logan1|||Original question||| I've been browsing on Craigslist and dealer websites and I've stumbled across a bunch of Rangers, most of which have been newer models (2008 and up), most have had clean titles, and most have had relatively low miles.
I was just wondering if a Ranger would make a good first car. I'd wanted a truck, then I found out the horrendous insurance costs and fuel costs for even a half-ton truck. I know that Rangers don't get the best fuel mileage, but I was wondering especially about the insurance costs for a new driver in a Ranger. Is it as high as a full size truck or is it cheaper seeing as how the Ranger is a compact truck. I have done some research and I have determined that a Ranger that has been taken care of will last forever before it quits (so long as I keep up general maintenance) however I haven't found any rough insurance estimates.

>>Fastlife91|||Original question||| Posted 10 minutes ago · Report post
I've had my 2006 ford focus sport 1.8 TDCI for almost 2 years now. I first noticed the car making this noise the day I was driving it home, I had other things on the car to investigate at the time hence why I didn't do much about it .
Anyway, I notice occasionally during idle the car chugs, If I bring clutch up to biting point the chugging goes away, it only chugs occasionally and when it does it is only during idling, I think once the car warms and reaches operating temperature the noise goes away. 
car drives great, even when it chugs at idle but I then proceed to drive it picks up greatly. 
Not the EGR as that has been replaced as well as MAF sensor e.t.c. 
When I first got the car, the injectors did leak a few times but he put a new seal on 1 of them and it began leaking around the leak off pipe but he put a cable tie around each one and have had no leaks since.
I would really like some opinions on what this noise could be as I've been hearing the noise since I bought the cart almost 2 years ago  ? 
thanks

>>benchtest|||Answer||| The 1.6L Kent is a pushrod engine.  Only European Escorts would use that engine.  The US Escort used the 1.6L CVH OHC engine.  Most Pintos used the 2.3L OHC engine, but maybe the early ones used the 1.6L - never checked, never will. 8)  If you have a Ford engine in your skid steer it would be an industrial motor.  I can't tell you the difference (but it won't be a CVH), but any Bobcat dealer should be able to tell you the motor information with a phone call.  Good luck. 
>>homertwo|||Followup-question||| Hello. The ford industrial is not the same as in any ford car. I have one in my Bobcat skidsteer. Mine is a 722. 
I guess there was more than one design. Mine has a T20 marking on the side. I bought a new short block thinking it was the same as mine. The marking on the side is VL11. Looked the same. But after getting them side by side. They are different. The VL11 is 1 inch shorter.
I can't use it useless I find all the rest of the parts for it.
It is brand new old stock. I paid $860 for it. Which is less than I will pay to sleave mine. I need at least 2 sleaves. 
I also have another T20 that has a rod sticking thru the block. So I have extra parts for it.

>>flobiwan|||Original question||| I brought my 2011 Ford Fiesta to the dealer yesterday afternoon because i was getting an Engine Malfunction alert on it.  The service tech told me that there was a recall on it for the door latches so they were going to replace them.  I said i didn't want that taking up time that could be spent diagnosing my problem.  She said it wouldn't be an issue.  
Well, i just called them at 1:45 this afternoon and they hadn't even started diagnosing the actual problem because they're working on the door latches.  That is exactly what i DIDN'T want to happen.  The man i spoke to over the phone said that because it's a safety issue, they have to do it.  
My question is, are they legally required to perform the recall repairs or can i say no to them?  I'm quite annoyed that i brought my car in for one thing and they decided to waste my time doing something else with it.

>>MikeCStig|||Original question||| Injector cleaner that is added to the fuel tank doesn't always work. The best fuel injector cleaner is the stuff that you apply directly to the injectors. Problems like what you've described are usually either fuel or fire. Clean the injectors the right way and if that doesn't work go through the ignition system thoroughly. Check the wires for continuity and test the coils. Also make sure you have the right spark plugs for your engine. If the gap on the plugs is wrong, you'd be surprised how many problems that could cause. 
>>>Title||| Last Model T
>>365DaysofMotoring|||Original question||| 26 May 1927 Henry Ford and his son Edsel drove the 15 millionth Model T Ford out of their factory, marking the famous automobile’s official last day of production. More than any other vehicle, the relatively affordable and efficient Model T was responsible for accelerating the automobile’s introduction into American society during the first quarter of the 20th century. Introduced in October 1908, the Model T—also known as the “Tin Lizzie”—weighed some 1,200 pounds, with a 20-horsepower, four-cylinder engine. It got about 13 to 21 miles per gallon of gasoline and could travel up to 45 mph. Initially selling for around $850 (around $20,000 in today’s dollars), the Model T would later sell for as little as $260 (around $6,000 today) for the basic no-extras model. Largely due to the Model T’s incredible popularity, the U.S. government made construction of new roads one of its top priorities by 1920. By 1926, however, the Lizzie had become outdated in a rapidly expanding market for cheaper cars. While Henry Ford had hoped to keep up production of the Model T while retooling his factories for its replacement, the Model A, lack of demand forced his hand. On May 25, 1927, he made headlines around the world with the announcement that he was discontinuing the Model T. As recorded by Douglas Brinkley in “Wheels for the World,” his biography of Ford, the legendary carmaker delivered a eulogy for his most memorable creation: “It had stamina and power. It was the car that ran before there were good roads to run on. It broke down the barriers of distance in rural sections, brought people of these sections closer together and placed education within the reach of everyone.” After production officially ended the following day, Ford factories shut down in early June, and some 60,000 workers were laid off. The company sold fewer than 500,000 cars in 1927, less than half of Chevrolet’s sales. The Model A’s release beginning in select cities that December was greeted by throngs of thousands, a tribute to Ford’s characteristic ability to make a splash. No car in history, however, had the impact—both actual and mythological—of the Model T: Authors like Ernest Hemingway, E.B. White and John Steinbeck featured the Tin Lizzie in their prose, while the great filmmaker Charlie Chaplin immortalized it in satire in his 1928 film “The Circus.”

hoping someone here can  help diagnose my car..need  to travel tomorrow for a death in the family  but also don't want to break down half way there.
About 4 months ago i got into a decent fender bender on my front right wheel/fender area.. it was repaired and since drove like nothing ever happened.
a  few days days ago i was driving then out the blue had a strange  grinding noise with somewhat of a strange whistle sound coming from that  area.. it occurred while driving approx 60kmh(40mph) straight, not  braking, turning or anything like that.
The car drives straight, doesn't wobble. just that noise. 
After  parking it then going back out it stopped. i wanted to try and recreate  the noise... couldn't figure it out as the noise doesn't always occur.  reoccurred slightly again yesterday while driving very slow. sometimes  the grinding is not noticeable and its more of a dull whistle. for about  2 seconds when i applied the brakes at one point the grinding stopped.
took my wheel off and caliper... took a peak at my brakes and such. everything looked good, they were changed this past summer. 
revved the engine, couldn't hear anything abnormal, checked oil and fluids everywhere.
checked battery terminals thinking maybe alternator was acting up..again seems ok.
I  called the garage that fixed my car and they said that some of the  areas components were replaced but they did not replace the wheel  bearing. so i did the only thing i knew and was to jack up the car and  try and wobble the tire for play. it was tight..plus it drives straight,  no shaking or wobbling so &quot;assuming&quot; it wasn't that..
since the  first time i heard the noise, i drove it approximately 25miles. did some  hard turns, drove fast, slow. other then the noise it doesn't seem to  affect the car. 
My issue is if it is the wheel bearing, i don't  want to be driving on a major hwy when my tire decides to fall off. The  mechanic at the garage told me its possible the bearing is starting to  fail... (i thought its either good or its not and theres no middle)
I  was thinking of jacking the car up on all 4's, sticking it in drive and  seeing if i can find the exact area the noise is coming from.. but  again even that wouldn't necessarily tell me whats wrong as there would  be no load on the tires.
any ideas of what i can do or advice?

>>>Title||| Advantages of Reconditioned Engines
>>EngineExperts|||Original question||| A reconditioned engine comes up with warranty. It is one that has been stripped, overhauled and rebuilt with new components. The level of rebuilding in each engine will vary from one to the next depending on their individual requirements. But the overall aim of the process is to rebuild the engine closer to its original factory condition. Meaning you are getting an engine which now essentially, has 'zero' miles. A very big advantage is that they have already gone through the break in period. So why will you spend so much on new engines when reconditioned engines serve the same purpose.
I can recommend you a very trustworthy reconditioned Ford Transit engine manufacturer. Here is their website: 
If you really need a reconditioned Ford Transit engine then you can have a look.

>>Fritz The Cat|||Original question||| 1986 302 w/ 160k miles. Loses oil pressure at idle after driving approx 10 miles. Rev engine to about 1500 rpm and hold it there, pressure builds back up. Oil &amp; filter change w/ 10W30 gives no improvement, oil &amp; filter change w/ 20W50 cures problem for 100 miles, then the pressure starts dropping again. In your opinion, oil pump problem or bad bearings? BTW, when pressure drops, I do not hear any lifter clatter. 
>>kaoru-tochiro|||Followup-question||| Is the engine all grungy inside? maybe it needs to git flushed. 
Also it'sa cheaper to stick on a new oil pump than a new engine. 
>>450HPviper|||Answer||| 
Quote:
>>HiFlow5 0</span>|||Followup-question||| Are you going off the stock gauge still? When pressure drops by how much are you talking? I would really suggest getting a more accurate gauge to monitor the exact oil pressure.
You have a 160k miles motor, it's going to start showing signs of wear. Low oil pressure can be associate with bad or warn bearings. As long as you don't get lower then 15psi, or spikes to 0, I wouldn't worry about it too much. Since you said pressure builds back up as rpms increase, things still sound ok. 
Remember this; As oil heats up it thins out, and as oil thins the oil pressure will drop. Now a motor oil like 20W50 is a lot thicker, and will create more oil pressure cause of its consistency. But like any oil it will thin as the oil heats up. Since you motor has 160k on it, and you have oil pressure problems, I would start to run a heavier weight oil to withstand the clearances the motor now has cause of wear.
One other thing. Oil pumps are no fun to change, and I don't really see that as your problem. From what you described, everything sounds right for a motor with high miles on it. 
>>Fritz The Cat|||Followup-question||| On the stock Ford truck style gauge, after 10 miles driving, when I stop at a light, the gauge will drop all the way to the left indicating no oil pressure. This is with 20W50. One thing I don't understand, if the oil pressure is that low, shouldn't I hear lifter clatter? 
>>HiFlow5 0</span>|||Followup-question||| So it only drops that bad at an idle? When cruising it's good? I would get an aftermarket gauge, something cheap, but good enough just to get a more accurate reading. The stock gauge will drop off after pressure reaches a certain level. So in reality you might have, say 5psi, but the gauge will read 0, that's why you don't hear lifter clatter.
How does the rest of the truck run? 
>>Fritz The Cat|||Followup-question||| Everything else is just fine. Allways starts up, runs like a champ. The only real problem I've ever had with it was the time the fuel pressure regulator went out, what a mess, gas everywhere. Even the air fiter box was soaked. I just wish Fords didn't rust so bad. 
>>Bize|||Followup-question||| Fritz the Cat, i have the same oil pressure problem in my 92 302 5.0 , i am getting a new oil pump done today, did you resolve your problem, and how, maybe i can let you know if this worked for me, please send me a email @  thanks 
>>vbrpete|||Followup-question||| Change your sending unit first(lower right side of the block,above the oil filter-looks like a bell with a wire on top) or better yet,get a REAL,mechanical o.p. gauge.Ford OP senders are crap.So are their gauges.Especially tachs on 5.0 Mustangs.Mine was out almost 800 rpm from what THREE aftermarket tachs read. 
>>IDAHO JOE|||Followup-question||| Hi:
I drive all over the NW for work and this truck is great. It is just shy of 300,000 miles and runs like a champ. The oil pressure always reads right in the middle of normal, but last week it dropped below the &quot;N&quot; in normal but no where near low or danger.
I keep this rig in pretty good shape and am getting concerned. I know it has 300K, but my last 302 made it to 475K, so I have a long ways to go. I gather from the messages here that the best way to go is:
1] replace sending unit
2] check pressure with a real gauge.
3] clean pan and intake tube.
4] change oil pump
5] drive it til she drops
6] new engine
BTW there is no lifter or engine noise at all and it is not
that serious now, but why wait for something serious?
Any comments, and has anyone had luck in regaining pressure
from changing the oil pump?
Thanks,

>>n2racing|||Answer||| Try revving the engine to about 2000 rpms. If you feel a vibration the mains are weak. I have discovered this situation many times in the past.

>>>Title||| Ford Thunderbird
>>365DaysofMotoring|||Original question||| he Ford Thunderbird went on sale as a 1955 model, and sold briskly; 3,500 orders were placed in the first ten days of sale. Ford had only projected building 10,000; eventual 1955 sales were 16,155. As standard, the 1955 Thunderbird included a removable fiberglass top; a fabric convertible top was an option, although commonly specified. The only engine option was a 292 Y-block V8. The exhausts exited through twin &quot;bullets&quot; above the rear bumper, as was the fashion. For the 1956 model, Ford made some changes. To give more trunk space, the spare wheel was mounted outside, Continental-style; the exhausts were moved to the ends of the bumper. Air vents were added behind the front wheels to improve cabin ventilation. To improve rear-quarter visibility with the removable hardtop in place, &quot;porthole&quot; windows were added to it. An optional 312 Y-block V8 was made available for those that wanted more performance.1956 sales were 15,631, the lowest of all three 2-seater Thunderbird model years. For 1957, a more radical restyle was performed. The front bumper was reshaped, with heavier sides, &quot;bullets&quot; at the ends of the grille, and the section below the grille dropping down. The grille was larger. The tailfins were made larger, more pointed, and canted outward; larger round tail-lights were fitted. The spare wheel moved inside the trunk again, which had been redesigned to allow it to be mounted vertically and take up less space. The side &quot;Thunderbird&quot; script moved from the fins to the front fenders. Engine options increased, because Ford went racing with the Thunderbird that year. As well as the standard 292 and 312 engines, versions of the 312 were produced in higher states of tune, and even a McCulloch supercharged version. 1957 sales were 21,380, including three extra months of production because the 1958 models were late.

>>65comet|||Followup-question||| It's my experience that if the fluid isn't low, then what you say is happening needs a tranny drop and a visit to a good rebuilder or a swap for another one if the rebuild is more than you can afford.  Could be an internal crack that as it warms up lets fluid go into other areas and not where it should be pushing pressure.  Or maybe worn out disc pack. 
>>LV1|||Answer||| Big time bad news. Took trans. out and found torque converter came apart inside and filled trans. with metal fillings ruining everthing. All back together and feels like I have a v-12 instead of a v-8 or maybe it's just because my pocket is alot lighter. 
>>>Title||| Ford Recalls 591K Vehicles
>>AF News Desk</span>|||Original question||| Ford has announced four new recalls which cumulatively affect about 591,000 vehicles. 
The largest of the recalls, which is calling back the 2013-2015 Ford Fusion, Lincoln MKZ and 2015 Ford Edge, affects about 520,000 vehicles alone. The issue lies with steering gear motor attachment bolts that can fracture, causing the vehicle to lose power steering. Only vehicles sold in corrosion states* are affected by this recall. Ford is not aware of any accidents or injuries as a result. Dealers will replace the attachment bolts free of charge.
SEE ALSO: Ford Recalls 390K Cars Over Doors That Can Fly Open
The next largest recall, which affects the 2014 Ford Focus, Edge, Escape, Transit Connect and 2014-15 Ford Fiesta, is calling back about 50,000 vehicles. The nickel plating on the fuel pump can cause the pump to seize, leading to a stall or the engine being unable to start. Ford says there is one allegation of an accident that is related to this problem. Dealers will replace the fuel delivery module for free on the affected vehicles.
Next up is a recall for 100 brand new 2015 Ford F-150s. These trucks have a heat shield that may have been improperly installed, leading to increased risk of a fire. Ford is not aware of any related incidents and will install the missing heat shield fasteners as needed.
Finally, about 22,600 Lincoln MKZ sedans from the 2015 model year are being recalled for park lamps that are brighter than regulations allow, which may affect the vision of other drivers. Ford isn’t aware of any related incidents and will update the body control module software to fix the issue, free of charge.
>>>Title||| Ford sets world record for biggest Hot Wheels track loop
>>AF News Desk</span>|||Original question||| Take Your Child to Work Day looks like a pretty amazing experience for a child if their parent works at  track loop in the atrium of the company's Research and Innovation Center in Dearborn, MI, and launched toy cars from over three stories.
The idea came from Ford dynamometer technician Matt West who had been building progressively larger loops with his son. This one was the biggest ever, though, with a ramp 35.5-feet high and a 12.5-foot loop to crush the previous record of nine feet, nine inches tall. Fittingly, the track was inaugurated with a  Hot Wheels car taking the first run.
To support such a massive size, the Hot Wheels track fits into a plywood structure that's bolted together. Beyond just being fun and looking incredibly cool, the stunt was meant to teach kids about mathematics and engineering. 
  Show full PR text
• To help children cultivate an interest in science and engineering, Ford attempted to set a new world record for building the largest Hot Wheels® car track loop as part of this year's Take Your Child to Work Day
• Ford Mustang Hot Wheels car started at more than three stories high inside Ford Research and Innovation Center
• Old record loop stood at nine feet, nine inches tall
DEARBORN, Mich., April 23, 2015 – Ford ran circles around the old Hot Wheels® record loop as part of this year's Take Your Child to Work Day. When the effort was complete, Ford had made a world record attempt with a Hot Wheels car track loop that exceeded 12 feet tall.
The world record attempt was the brainchild of Ford dynamometer technician Matt West, who had built increasingly large Hot Wheels loops with his six-year-old son Blade at their home in Monroe, Michigan.
The attempt took place in the three-story atrium of the company's Research and Innovation Center in Dearborn in support of Ford's participation in national Take Your Child to Work Day.
&quot;It started as part-fun, part-physics lesson with my son at home,&quot; said West. &quot;We built one in our playroom, and then built a five-foot- tall loop in our backyard. When people at Ford heard what we were up to, everyone thought it would be a great way to get young people excited about science and engineering by trying to break the world record on Take Your Child to Work Day.&quot;
The current record of nine feet, nine inches tall was set in Ohio. West and his friends at Ford successfully made a Mustang Hot Wheels car complete a 12-foot, six-inch loop.
&#65532;
&quot;On a track, a Hot Wheels car can only go so fast, so carrying the momentum of the vehicle through an entire loop is harder than you might think,&quot; said West. &quot;In a world where kids are inundated with TVs and tablets, I thought teaching my son with actual moving vehicle models would be so much more rewarding, and then it took on a life of its own.&quot;
Early on, West and Blade went to work dreaming up the world record-breaking loop. With the help of others at Ford, including John Jaranson, technical expert in interior systems, and Grant Compton, computer-aided design engineer, they created the loop using computer-aided design software called CATIA, which is often used for car design.
Knowing they had to create the super structure out of four-by- eight-foot sheets of plywood, they designed the loop into sections that would get bolted together.
Once designed, the team enlisted the help of Will Brick, general manager of TechShop Detroit, a membership-based, do-it- yourself workshop and fabrication studio, to bring the digital design files to life. Jaranson is a member of TechShop, thanks to Ford's innovative relationship with the company, a part-time instructor who helps other members utilize the available tools. The team cut the sheets of plywood using a water jet cutter.
&quot;At TechShop, we like to say, 'Build your dreams here,'&quot; said Brick. &quot;It was great to help Matt and to work with the Ford team to bring his son's idea to reality.&quot;
&quot;It's an honor for Hot Wheels to have inspired Matt West and the Ford team to embark on such an epic world record attempt,&quot; said Chris Down, senior vice president and general manager, Hot Wheels. &quot;Ford and Mattel have a history going back more than four decades. We both have tremendous passion for pushing the limits of design, and we're happy to be involved in trying to generate enthusiasm for science and technology for kids everywhere.&quot;
With its signature 1:64-scale models, Hot Wheels has created hundreds of Ford Motor Company vehicles, including many of the original 16 Hot Wheels models released in 1968 – a custom Mustang, Thunderbird and Cougar.

>>>Title||| New guy post, howdy all.
>>Dave Bulla|||Original question||| Hi all.
Just signed up and put a post in the expedition forum where I'm looking for some help with the rear air ride on a 98 EB. Figured I'd post here and introduce myself a bit.
Not much of a car enthusiast but more of a fix things out of necessity sort of guy. Prefer to spend my extra cash money on hunting or shooting related stuff but here I am... 
I've been an aviation mechanic/avionics tech most of my life but did do industrial maintenance for about ten years after I gave up on aviation back in the post 911 days when all was doom and gloom. I know a few things about turning a wrench or electrical stuff but really don't often work on cars. In fact, never do unless I have to... Right now I REALLY have to get this one fixed.
Looking for help on short notice. Have to have this thing fixed by this weekend so my wife will have transportation next week. Found this forum while looking for info on troubleshooting a Ford air ride and thought I'd sign up to ask for some help. Already read a little bit but it seems most posts keep getting more and more questions tagged on until the original posters question is lost so instead of tagging mine onto an old topic I figured I'd start a new one. 
I also figure that like most forums I go to, the general forum is the place most people hang out so I wanted to jump in here, say howdy and shamelessly link back to my post in the expedition forum which is here:
Hope to hear from some of you Ford experts real soon with some good (and very specific) info.

>>>Title||| Two CDs stuck in player?!?!?
>>lmoseley|||Original question||| Two CDs stuck in player?!?!?
We have a 1999 Windstar van with the premium radio/tape/CD player, the one with the slot-loader CD.  
There was already a CD in the player and the kid inserted a second CD on top of the first one.  Surprisingly, the player accepted both and now NEITHER will eject.
I have tried the normal &quot;first thoughts&quot; ideas like reaching in the slot with tweezers and needle-nose pliers.  No joy.  EJECT button does not work.  I see no indication of a manual release.
Surely we are not the first to have this problem... does anyone have a solution short of paying a mechanic to disassemble the player and remove them?
Thanks in advance for any help! 
>>The Bondo Bandit|||Answer||| theres not alot you can do aside from poking around in the slot with some sort of poking device , or taking the radio out . if you take the radio out generally you can take the top off and just take your cd's out . 
>>slacker_53|||Followup-question||| Maybe if you remove the radio, it would be easier to get the CDs out??
Ford radios remove from the front, the four holes in the front, two in a vertical pattern on the left side and two in a vertical pattern on the right side are where the releases are that allow you to remove the radio.
You can actually buy the 'tools' to do this at Walmart in the car stereo section of automotive. (I think about $5)
What you get are two pieces of steel rod, bent into a 'U' shape. All you do is push one of these into the holes on the left and the other into the holes on the right. This allows you to pull the radio right out of the front of the dash. All that is left is to unplug the radio and then either you can work on it yourself or drop it off at your local radio store for them to work on.
Good luck on getting them out!

>>87civicfranky|||Followup-question||| What the hell was that little boy thinking??!!?!??!!!  
Try to poke it out with a bike spoke... &quot; DO NOT PRY IT OUT DISCONNECTED!!&quot; Doing so, the player wont eject at all and will stay frozen..(even if you get the cd out.) Attempt it while hitting the eject botton. My friend had the same problem and i manneged to get it out..(but that same day his little son made a playdoe cd and you know..... that things in the dump...) 
>>Winters4|||Followup-question||| Hi,
I just had this problem in a Kia Sportage.  2 CD's had stuck together, and my daughter inserted them into the player, not noticing it was more than 1 CD.  At first, it wouldn't play at all.  But, I turned it off and back on, and the bottom CD played.  However, when she tried to eject them, an error message appeared.  We tried several times, but no luck.  
I then used a butter knife with a thin blade, and inserted in into the CD opening until I was able to get the blade in between the 2 CD's.  I first tried to used a pair of needle-nose tweezers (with small pieces of electrical tape on the ends to protect the CD's) to grab the top CD.  I saw this method on another forum.  But, I couldn't grasp the top CD tightly enough to remove it. 
I decided to turn the unit on, hit eject button, and see what happened.  The top CD slid right out on top of the knife blade. 
Then I removed the knife and first CD, hit eject again, and the other CD came out, too.  CD's now play fine in the player.  It doesn't seem like either of the CD's that were in the player were damaged either, as they both play fine.
I hope this will help someone with the same problem. 
>>Chaz.Nicoll|||Answer||| You know the best way i found to get a cd out of a cd player that wont eject is a paperclip.. Now you bend the end of the clip to make a hook, find the hole in the cd and then hook it and pull it out! Works everytime!!

>>>Title||| 351PCM - Weird Starter problem
>>JRexrode|||Original question||| Hello. I have a ski boat with a Ford engine (1994 351PCM).
It has a starting (starter) issue. Hopefully someone can offer some clues as to what's behind it. I'll list what I know so far:
- I have good power to the solenoid (12V).
- Turning key (ignition), I hear the solenoid click. no starter.
- I jump the connections at the solenoid, starter spins fine.
- I go back to the ignition, it turns over fine, as if no problem.
- I try the ignition again next time, solenoid only, again.
- I jump the solenoid again, starter still spins fine.
- Back the ignition, turns over fine.
- yet on next try, same deal, no starter....
I can repeat this over and over.
For some reason, if I spin the engine (socket on harmonic balancer) then the next ignition try usually gets a start. not always, sometimes takes a few tries. Once in a while, it does start fine... rarely. Mostly if it's been run recently. Not a flywheel issue, teeth are all good.
Something between the starter and solenoid?? Being a boat, moisture is around sometimes. But strange the repeatable sequence that gets it to go. No single component seems faulty, but together something is haywire.
Thanks for any clues!! Jim

>>>Title||| Ford dumps MyFord Touch name in revamp of infotainment system
>>AF News Desk</span>|||Original question||| Ford Motor Co. is dropping the name “MyFord Touch” in an overhaul of the touch-screen infotainment system that sent its quality ratings plummeting in recent years.
 The new system, which Ford calls “Sync 3,” uses BlackBerry's in-car operating system, QNX, instead of the Microsoft technology that has underpinned Sync since its introduction in 2007. 
 Sync 3 will be available starting in the 2016 model year and offered throughout the full Ford and Lincoln lineups by the end of the 2016 calendar year, .
       
 With Sync 3, Ford hopes to resolve the bugs and complaints that turned MyFord Touch from an industry-leading feature into a liability. Raj Nair, Ford’s product development chief and chief technical officer, said the company incorporated more survey data and feedback into Sync 3 than it has when rolling out any new vehicle.
 Nair said Sync 3 -- so named because it’s the third generation of Sync, with the second being MyFord Touch -- is designed to be more intuitive and quicker than the current system, which Ford introduced in 2010 to make its vehicles stand out among technology-craving, smartphone-carrying consumers. He said it’s designed to be “device agnostic,” working with any type of smartphone, though it does include Siri Eyes Free capability for more seamless integration with Apple Inc.’s iPhones.
 “We don’t want you making a purchase decision about a $30,000 automobile based on your $200 smartphone,” Nair told reporters at a demonstration this week.
 The 8-inch screen is the same size as MyFord Touch, but text is larger, touch zones are larger and background colors are brighter. Voice controls respond to more conversational language and return simpler prompts if the system fails to understand what was said.
 “Simplicity has value,” Parish Hanna, Ford’s global director of human machine interface, said in a statement. “Reducing the number of things on-screen also makes control easier, and is designed to limit the number of times a driver has to glance at the screen.”
 The system can automatically update itself using an owner’s home wireless network, whereas Ford had to or asking customers to visit a dealership. Vehicles equipped with MyFord Touch will not be able to upgrade to Sync 3.
 Ford said pricing for Sync 3, which will be standard on the Titanium trim level, will be comparable to that of MyFord Touch and MyLincoln Touch, which cost about $1,000 when elected as an option. Ford won’t have a distinct name for the Lincoln version of Sync 3, though the system will have a different visual theme when installed in Lincolns.
 The base level of Sync without the touch screen will remain available and continue to use Microsoft’s operating system. As the new system is rolled out,  will be selling all three generations of Sync simultaneously.
 The move from MyFord Touch to Sync 3 -- and from Microsoft to Blackberry -- comes as Chrysler Group and other competitors offer touch-screen systems that have been more positively received. Ford already has brought back many of the it had replaced with capacitive sliders and switches that drivers and reviewers said were more distracting and difficult to use while driving.
  titled “Why the MyFord Touch control system stinks.” The piece concluded: “We wouldn’t recommend dealing with the frustrations of MyFord Touch on a daily basis even to an adversary.”
 Whereas MyFord Touch divided audio, climate controls, navigation and phone connectivity into four quadrants on the screen, Sync 3 has a menu bar along the bottom of the screen with six options, adding “apps” and “settings” to the original four. In that way, it’s similar to Chrysler’s Uconnect system, which features seven large icons along the bottom of the screen so a user can easily switch from music to navigation or a phone call.
 Mark Boyadjis, an analyst at the consultancy IHS Automotive who has been briefed on Sync 3, said Ford officials told him that they heavily benchmarked Uconnect. He said Ford’s main goal with Sync 3 was clearly to fix the mistakes of MyFord Touch.
 “The focus here was not on creating a brand-new platform full of features that no one else had -- it was on creating something that would be exponentially easier to use than the old system,” Boyadjis said.
 “I’m convinced that this will be a better solution than their current platform. Will it be something that makes people drop everything and run to the nearest Ford dealer? I’m not so sure of that.”
 In 2010, the year that MyFord Touch made its debut, Ford was the top mass-market brand on J.D. Power and Associates Initial Quality Study and ranked No. 5 overall. Just one year later, the automaker had plunged to No. 23.
 Taking a leadership role in dashboard computing “is going to be good for Ford in the long term, but it is a short-term hit,” David Sargent, Power’s vice president of global vehicle research, said in an interview upon the release of the 2011 report. “They’re feeling the pain of taking risks while others wait to see what Ford learns.”
 In developing Sync 3 over the past 18 months, Ford was influenced by some 22,000 comments and suggestions from users, Nair said. It had thousands of MyFord Touch users test various prototypes at 30 clinics and on Ford’s virtual driving simulator, then adjusted the system based on their feedback.
 A Ford spokesman said the MyFord Touch name was killed not over negative associations with it but because consumers in testing tended to refer to the system as Sync. The company officially calls the current version “Ford Sync with MyFord Touch” in the U.S. and Sync 2 in Europe. Referring to the system as Sync 3 follows the same protocol that Apple and many other smartphone makers use to differentiate each version of their models.
  
>>65comet|||Answer||| All these systems, after 5 minutes of studying, need to be able to be used correctly if you were to put a blocking screen between it and your field of vision.  In all my current cars after a few minutes of learning the controls I can do everything without taking my eyes off the road.  Anything else is a danger and should not be there. 
>>>Title||| Ignition woes and dead fuse panel
>>WetScapes|||Original question||| I tried asking on the Econoline page, however I know this is a very common setup used in many Fords. I have a 88-89 Class &quot;C&quot; motorhome
 It says 88 on title but it's my understanding that they stopped using carbs in 89 and ours is FI. It's been sitting a Looong time, only has 43K on it. I had it running and then a few days later it just stopped, been through the whole fuel system and have all those issues fixed (I think).
 But then the starter burned out (again I think) so new starter, new starter solenoid, new battery, new ignition switch. But when we turn the key no power is getting to the starter?? Dome light comes on, headlights work. The key has gotten stiff to turn that's why I changed it but it's still the same. Should I be looking for fusible links, or start taking the steering column apart?? 
 I mentioned dead fuse panel but I was checking with a cheap questionable tester, I will be using my digital Fluke today.
 Thanks in advance for any helpful advice or criticism... 
>>>Title||| Bob Rewey, Ford marketing exec who moved the iron, dies at 76
>>AF News Desk</span>|||Original question||| Robert Rewey, a former Ford Motor Co. sales and marketing chief who helped the company become dominant in the SUV market, pioneered leasing as an alternative to traditional financing and pushed a controversial consolidation of Ford’s dealership network in the late 1990s, died Saturday at his home in Palm Beach, Fla., after a brief illness.
 He was 76.
 Rewey retired from Ford in 2001 after a 38-year career that included a variety of high-level positions. He was a current board member at Sonic Automotive, LoJack Corp. and Speedway MotorSports.
 Ford Executive Chairman Bill Ford, in a statement, praised Rewey as “a great marketing visionary.” Bill Ford, who became CEO a few months after Rewey retired, later turned to Rewey for help leading the company through a difficult period.
 “He inspired a passion for connecting with the customer at Ford and initiated many groundbreaking marketing innovations, including leasing and brand management that set the standard for the entire auto industry,” Bill Ford said. “He was a compassionate leader who served as a role model for so many people that were fortunate enough to know him and work with him. Our sincerest condolences and thoughts go out to his wife, Suzanne, and the entire Rewey family.”
 Rewey often described his primary responsibility as “moving the iron.”
  Rewey, left, general manager of the Ford Division, unveiled plans for a Ford product and technology display at the Renaissance Center in downtown Detroit in October 1986. 
 A 1997 profile of him released by Ford described him as “more social scientist than salesman, more engineer than ad man, and more master strategist than master of ceremonies.”
 “Marketing’s role is to be the customer’s champion,” Rewey was quoted in the profile as saying, “to assure that every product and service decision be made with the full understanding of who the customer actually is, and what he or she ultimately wants.”
 As vice president of marketing, sales and service for Ford Motor, Rewey announced in 1998 that the Lincoln-Mercury division would move its main office out of Michigan to adopt a “California state of mind.”
 He is also credited with helping to reverse a plan to convert the Ford Mustang to front-wheel drive, making him a hero among Mustang dealers and enthusiasts.
  car of the year in 1986. 
 But he rankled many dealers when Ford began an experiment that involved consolidating stores in metropolitan areas through joint ventures with Ford as an investor. The Ford Retail Network ultimately failed.
 At his retirement in March 2001, Rewey was Ford’s group vice president of global consumer services and North America. He joined the Sonic board of directors later in 2001.
 “Bob was just a really fantastic individual that over his career and life affected so many people,” Sonic Automotive President Scott Smith said today. “He had a wealth of knowledge that made our company so much stronger. It’s a tremendous loss for us.”

Mainly it deprives the general membership of info that could benefit them, not only now but in the future as well. Think of AF as a giant reference tool if you will with information constantly being added and updated. When someone posts an issue they look for responses to help them solve that issue. Most of the time a resolution is found to the problem. The beauty of that is now that thread and posts become part of the site to become search results if someone should have a similar problem whether it be in a couple weeks or a couple of years. The info permanently becomes part of the site to be used by all. By asking other members to contact you off site you are not allowing that info to be displayed where it may become valuable info to someone else. You are in essence depriving others access to that info.
Another reason is that it generally is not a good idea to be posting your email address on large message boards ,(or most places on the internet for that matter,) as that address could be used by spammers to send you all sorts of emails offering you little blue pills or a competitive rate on your mortgage.

>>AWDriver|||Original question||| 
I've got my E85 conversion chart up and running. It is my desire to prove/disprove what works and what needs changing in older model cars to run higher concentrations of ethanol. We've got a Chevy Caprice on the list that runs without any problems at all. A 221,000mile Honda runs it, too. Neither have any difficulties. Factories have blown smoke up your ass as to what works and what doesn't on their cars for E85. It's more or less on orders from big oil, too. 
I don't take orders from either one. 
E85 worked fine in my Subaru for 15,000 miles. The 221k Honda has run it for 30,000 miles. The Caprice has run it for 8,000 miles. 3 more WRX's have run it for 3,000-12,000 miles apiece with varying stages of mods. There is no voodoo or boogeymen involved in running this stuff. However, we're still in the beginning stages of folks running this stuff, and those who are testing it aren't fighting with the doubters and nay-sayers that say we can't do it. 
We're all proving that it works with very little labor and parts changes. there's more of you out there using it, too. Please let us know who you are!

>>KimMG|||Followup-question||| How is the fuel economy with the various vehicles mentioned above?  What are the costs associated with modifying the vehicles?  How are the rubber parts holding up? 
>>AWDriver|||Answer||| 
Quote:
>>KimMG|||Followup-question||| Since E85 is 15% less gasoline, and you have noticed a 10-15% loss in fuel economy, sounds like the ethanol is an inert ingredient.  I see no advantage of spending money on converting a car to run on E85 when I have to stop to refuel more often.
Have you done any testing using bio-diesel?  From what I have read (not much) bio-diesel seems interesting on a small scale, taking a waste product from cooking and using it as a fuel. 
>>AWDriver|||Answer||| 
Quote:
>>KimMG|||Followup-question||| I know alcohol is not an inert ingredient.  My understanding was E85 is 85% gas and 15% ethanol.  I now know that the ratio is the other way around, 85% alcohol and 15% gasoline.  Ethanol has been used for years in drag racing due to higher horse power output.  
I'm all for developing alternative energy sources.  One example is that I think all new home construction should have solar panels for generating electricity and heating water.
I live in an area where a gallon of fuel is 90% gasoline and 10% ethanol.  I have noticed a drop in fuel economy with my vehicles.  With higher pump prices and less miles to the gallon, I'm paying more for each mile I drive.  I'm also having higher maintenance costs with one of my cars due to the rubber fuel lines deteriorating at a faster rate.  I have had to refresh the carburetor twice due to failing seals in seven years and I only put about 45,000 miles on the car in that period of time.  
What kind of longevity have you experienced with the new parts?  Specifically flexible fuel lines, seals and electric fuel pumps.
If the true costs of converting a vehicle to E85 is around $500- and the price of fuel per gallon were to drop to $1-, I can see most people recouping the costs of conversion in less than a year, and provided there are no excessive maintenance costs, drivers getting more miles to the dollar.

>>65comet|||Original question||| Ok, in high humidity situations you can have the inside of your windows fog up.  And the best solution is air circulation and lowering of the humidity.  But my wife has a unique situation, she is a school bus driver.  Tons of kids exhaling moisture, wet clothes from standing at the bus stop and a door constantly opening to let them on and off.  So let's leave mechanical means out of the discussion and just talk about chemical applications.
I have put normal Rain-X on the inside of a car windshield before.  Biggest mistake ever.  Instead of occasional fogging it was constantly fogging.  On another car I (got smarter this time) used Rain-X Anti-fog on just the passenger side of the windshield.  But I saw no difference in the amount of fogging or in the speed it went away after starting the defrosters compared to the untreated drivers side.  I have also tried foaming shaving cream applied and wiped off that showed no difference.  Anyone use anything else with any success?

>>65comet|||Followup-question||| The money you spend on the engine will probably never given enough return in savings for the cost of gas.  Do whatever you want to the engine because you want it done for the power.  The better investment for mileage is a newer transmission with an additional gear to get your rpms lower at highway speeds.
Yesterday I was calculating on if I could somehow improve the car I'm driving from 32 to 39 MPG (an additional 7) for my daily 125 mile commute, at today's local price it would save me $2.44.  Most changes you do to that engine would possibly add 4 MPG, not a lot unless you are putting in the miles I am.  Though percentage wise it would be an improvement if your starting MPG is 9 or 10.  I suggest on the engine getting a base mileage usage and then a complete tuneup.

I'm now going into my second year of driving and I want to replace my slow, uncomfortable Renault Clio for something that looks and drives a bit better.
I'm really interested in a 1.8 Mk1 Focus, they're cheap - they look nice (after wheels and tints) and they seem to have some really strong zetec engines. 
I'm just writing to ask for some opinions and advice on buying one. My budget is about £1200 and i'm looking to get one from 2000-2002. I'm assuiming the milage on them will be about 130,000... is this ok for the car? Is there anything I should be looking for e.g. problems with the model and also what are they like to drive? Mpg, speed and smoothness. Planning on getting one in the next two weeks.
Also Is there maybe another car I should be looking into for my price range that is a mixture of speed, smoothness and good looks? Maybe a mk4 Golf?

>>>Title||| Ford 500 S.H.O.?
>>brokenantimatter|||Original question||| I spend a lot of time at my local regional Ford dealer and I saw today being unloaded off a truck an AWD Ford 500. AWD 500s are nothing special but the GM called me over and told me to open the hood. This car contained the Volvo XC90 engine(DOHC, 4.4L, 311hp) built by Yamaha. Garland Ford is getting five total and Cotton said the total production number would probably only be 501. He wasn't able to give me a price or date on the cars yet.
Any thoughts? 
>>sheebeehuh|||Followup-question||| I read on the Lincoln site that Lincoln's version of the 500 (the Lincoln MKS?) will have the 4.4L V8 Volvo engine standard.  Maybe they built a limited number of 500's as a test-bed for the Lincoln (or as a possible police car).
Did the dealer have a price? 
>>brokenantimatter|||Answer||| $38,300 - $40,065
 I just realized I am not sure if that is MSRP or Invoice price. 
>>sheebeehuh|||Answer||| Ouch!  You can get a lot of cars (that don't look like a bar of soap) for that kind of money. 
>>brokenantimatter|||Answer||| Actually that is a pretty low price once you think about the fact that the 1998 3.4L FWD SHO started at $32,495. 
>>sheebeehuh|||Followup-question||| Understood, but the previous SHO didn't sell well and that was, in part, due to it's price.  Also, I was thinking in terms of what other new cars you could buy in that price range (or less):
- Dodge Charger R/T, Chrysler 300C (345hp HEMI or even the 425hp SRT/8 models)
- Chevrolet Impala SS, Pontiac Grand Prix GXP (303hp V8)
- Toyota Avalon (w/ a 268hp V6)
- Hyundai Azera (w/ 263hp V6)
- Acura TL (w/ 258hp V6)
The sedan market has some stiff competition right now.  I, like a lot of people, would certainly would prefer a V8 so that works in Ford's favor but the 500 is just too plain in it's exterior design to compete well with some of the above cars in that price range (some of the above are actually considerably cheaper).
That said, thanks for the info on the 500 SHO.  I'll keep an eye for one on the Ford dealer's lot.  Maybe I'd be more impressed than I think. 
>>brokenantimatter|||Followup-question||| Dodge Charger SRT8
If you look at it the Ford 500 really has the most going for it. It will have the 4th highest quarter mile, the best braking and driveline, the best top speed and a superior built engine. Plus it is most likely the Ford 500 V8 will be listed as an SVT which will give the same aftermarket parts avalibility as  the Impala/Pontiac and the SRT-8s. With that in mind the 500 will prove to be a better built engine performance wise (imo) because Chrysler is already pushing what their 6.1 liter Hemi's can do when the Yamaha V8 is still in its virgin state.
As far as the body styling is concerned I find it a lot more innovative and appealing than the Toyota, 300c (looks like a fucking Bently Tank) and the Impala SS. Granted it doesn't come anywhere close to the agreesive Charger or Acura/Hyundia sleekness (which both look like Jaguar rip offs) but it is far from an ugly car. 
>>G-man422|||Answer||| I bet its a good overall car, but personally, the styling is a little bland.

>>brcidd|||Answer||| Yes, they make tranny cooling hose- done it many times.  rubber does not corrode. 
>>65comet|||Followup-question||| Make sure it is a rubber that can handle tranny fluid.  Some will allow tranny fluid to penetrate in and soften as well as expand the rubber.  Then it will just blow apart if it has any pressure in it.  That is why brcidd said &quot;they make tranny cooling hose&quot;.  I can't remember which rubber hose is an absolute no, no when it comes to that.  I know I've used anything just to get home in an emergency, then immediately bought the correct hose material.

>>65comet|||Answer||| Both are usable.  It depends mostly on your climate and a smaller amount on the age/mileage.  If you have a lot of high heat days or an engine that is worn and would do better to run cooler, go with the lower.  If you are freezing in your cab all the time in the winter, go with the higher.  You could swap each spring/fall if you want a cooler running engine in the summer and don't want frost bitten toes in the winter.
But I've tended to stay with a cooler thermostat year round on any vehicle old enough to need a replacement thermostat.  Then put cardboard in front of half the radiator on days below zero. 
>>>Title||| Keyless entry Remote??
>>Mustang_Driver|||Original question||| I bought a 2001 windstar that has remote start but i am missing the remotes for it. I contacted the company that deals with ford car alarm/remote start installs in the Vancouver,BC area but they want 200.00 for a replacement remote with no guarantees that it will work and up to 800.00 to remove the system. what i am looking for is i picture of the remote that might have come with it as the tech that looked at it said it was an old system and it was either a 4 or 5 button remote? he had one but wouldn't show it to me as i think he knew what i was thinking (take a picture and search ebay) so if anyone has a 2001 with remote start and power locks that has a key fob that sounds familiar any help would be appreciated. i tried to find a part number under the dash but couldn't find one i will look again when the weather changes for the better

Are people going straight to forums that only deal with their particular make or model?  Is the economy improving so they are paying to have their cars worked on or trading them in?  Are they smarter and searching the forum for previous answers first before asking a question?  I had thought it might be a seasonal cycle, but it has been going on too long to be that.  The car model forum is getting many more posts then the real cars by a large margin.  So again, what are your thoughts?

>>Galaxie Girl|||Original question||| Fired up my 1959 Ford Fairlane 500 (Galaxie) recently, and there was gas leaking from the fuel pump/vacuum booster.  I don't know for sure yet exactly what is leaking (I'm guessing diaphragm...?).  I can't find anything online about buying just a diaphragm for the pump, I only find the entire pump/booster for sale (and the ones I find for sale look slightly different than what's shown in my repair manual).  Do I have to replace the entire pump/booster, or does someone sell the diaphragm?    Any tips appreciated! 
>>65comet|||Followup-question||| I always had to buy a whole pump.  I had taken the pumps apart to verify it was the diaphragm.  And for an emergency fix used RTV black to seal a small hole on the side that doesn't have fuel flow past it.  But more times than not the diaphragm was rotten, the springs worn out, the pin for the arm worn out that you had to replace the whole thing.

>>drummerboy222|||Original question||| Hi all,
I play in a band and we're looking to upgrade our ride to a bigger vehicle like a bus. Shuttle buses seem PERFECT for what we're looking for... in our price range, spacious, wheelchair lift for loading in heavy gear, etc.
However, someone recently brought up the fact that shuttle buses may not be rated for long trips. He thought they might only be designed to carry heavy loads just a short distance, and that maxing one out at 55-60 mph down the highway for 2 hours could ruin it.
I would LOVE to get some info on this... thanks in advance!
Bryan 
>>typesix|||Followup-question||| Many years ago(30+), transit buses likely similar to your shuttle bus, came in two configurations. Some were rated only for city use and some were rated for city/highway. The difference is that the latter had different transmission with extra gear(s) for highway use. I don't know whether that is the case today. You could likely contact the bus manufacturer for info or perhaps find a bus repair facility that could tell you by taking a quick look at the bus.

Thanks 
>>65comet|||Followup-question||| A few years back in the Escape thread I had arguments with a hybrid owner about the pitfalls of hybrid vs. regular.  I showed facts and figures that the higher initial cost would not be made back in gas savings for at least seven or eight years.  Then I went on to mention that the batteries had been shown to have a steep decline in capacity after 5 years, so there would be the additional cost of replacement at that time.  Then there are the articles showing how more pollution is created in making a hybrid than what the non-hybrid puts out in its lifetime.  I wouldn't buy any hybrid until they can come up with a &quot;new&quot; battery.  2008 is a year away from the 5 year mark.  The latest news is that there isn't any idea of how to make one yet.  So I'm looking at the news of compressed air vehicles and also hoping hydrogen fuel can get going soon.

>>>Title||| What is the MAF sensor for? And is it that important?
>>IZ1111|||Answer||| I recently put an air intake on my car. I first left the MAF sensor uninstalled, and just ran it with the air temp sensor, and it ran great. But then I thought to myself, I better but that MAF sensor in there to just to be sure my car gets everything it needs to run. But once I but it in there, the car felt like the horsepower was restricted. The acceleration was poor, and the responce was crappy. I then took it off, and the car ran as great as before.
Is it really that important to have that sensor installed, or can my car survive without it. Thanks for any info. 
>>lectraplayer|||Original question||| I've always heard that it was highly important--to the point that if it crapped out, you were lucky if the car would even run.  It may be great now, but as the air filter clogs up from use, you go up and down mountains, or there is another change in air intake volume for the RPM and loading of the engine, then your car may not be doing so hot.  The mass airflow sensor would give the first clue that something has changed and your car would adjust quickly.  I don't even see how it's even running, and emissions would likely stink (literally!).  Definitely leave it connected. 
>>IZ1111|||Followup-question||| Thats what I thought to myslef too. But it runs great without it. But if I connect it, my car would shut itself down. But I've even tryed rotating the sensor 90 degrees so it wont cool down the littlle wires as much, but when I go faster or accelerate, when it shifts to the second gear, my car would stop, them go and stop and go, countinuosly until I deccelerate. Since my previous post I've tried many little things to see how I can have the MAF sensor connected without giving my any problems, but nothing yet that keeps my car running good. So I've left it out, and it runs perfectly. Without any running problems. I've read that its the sensor that regulates the air and fuel mixture, but I wonder when its disconected, how does the car know how much feul to give it? But I guess it knows, because its running and nicely too.
Here is a pic of what I did (I'll post it in the next one). Its a 92 Crown Vic. 
>>IZ1111|||Followup-question||| Here is the pic of my air intake. Note that I dont have the MAF sensor connected. It used to be in the trunk of my car but I have tried everyway to put the MAF sensor in there so I can make it work somehow. I've even tried turning it 90 degrees so it wont cool the little wires as fast, but this just made the car crazy. Until I find a better way to have the MAF sensor installed, I'm going to put it back in the trunk until I find a better way.
>>lectraplayer|||Followup-question||| I know the PCM (powertrain control module, the electronic brain) also gets clues on the fuel mixture from the oxygen sensors by the cat, and it may just calculate the amount it needs from the throttle position sensor.  If the throttle position sensor's going bad, the car will do all sorts of cussing as there will be an error in the fuel/air mixture from time to time.  It sounds like your mass airflow sensor may be fowled up.  Are any of the wires inside broken? 
>>TeamExploder|||Answer||| Reason it maybe running crappy is because the computer needs reset, since you've left the MAF off the computer as adjusted differently if you want it to run right if you haven't already install the MAF again and unhook the negative battery terminal for bout 10-15 minutes that's usually enough time for the computer to reset then you can hook the terminal back up and run it for awhile and let the computer get readjusted to the air intake its actually getting so it can mix the right combination of fuel. 
>>TENGRAM|||Followup-question||| the MAF just measures the amount of incoming air. when it is dettached, or there is a fault code stored, the ECM uses input from the TPS and BP sensor to make an educated guess about how much air is entering the engine. it will (as you've noticed) run ok like that, but it is not optimum for performance and will increase fuel consumption. 
have you tried using a shield inboard of your air filter? when the air filter is in the engine compartment like that it is very common to have fan wash create turbulance that detrimentally affects the MAF sensor readings. with the MAF hooked up how does it idle? rough?
with the MAF hooked up you should have the codes pulled and see whats what.
i didn't check your other thread but if you haven't cleaned the MAF sensor element with electrical contact cleaner or brake cleaner yet, you should. freshly oiled (or new) air filters will leave oil residue on the element that will mess things up. 
>>Davescort97</span>|||Followup-question||| When the MAF sensor is taken out of the loop the PCM reverts to a richer mixture by default. With a cold air intake it's getting more air and with the richer mixture is probably why it runs so good. 
>>TeamExploder|||Answer||| Hmm....never heard of using brake cleaner just that one special alcohol I can't think of and electrical contact cleaner. 
>>TENGRAM|||Answer||| 
Quote:
>>TeamExploder|||Followup-question||| well thanks for the tip, I've been thinking of cleaning mine just didn't know what to use without having to buy a can of something that I'll use once or twice. 
>>IZ1111|||Followup-question||| My MAF sensor is actualy clean. And it runs nicely when its idle. Its when accelerating like above 20mph when there is a problem. The car would actualy stal for a second and then accelerate a second then stal again and then accelarate and keeps doing this until I just stop. But this is no way of driving, so I took it off completely. I've read more into it, and I've read that the sensor works by cooling the little wires, the more air that flows trough them the cooler the wires become. But it seems that it cools it so fast that the PCM must think that there is a serious problem and cuts fuel to the engine and then the car slows down meaning less air coming in, but then starts to run again and cools the little coiled wired again with the massive air coming in and then it looks like a driving student whos barely learing how to drive is driving the car.
I maby thinking of making a little housing where the coils are, and only have one section of air hitting it, but not enough to cool the wires. But I dont know it this will work. 
>>TeamExploder|||Answer||| Well not entirely sure if it cools wires but it is true that it lets the computer adjust fuel and air mixture. And can cause poor gas mileage 
>>TENGRAM|||Answer||| sounds like you may have an intermittant wiring problem. may help to do these tests (might want to even jiggle the wires abit while you test them):
>>cardude11|||Followup-question||| Your car can run short term without a mass air flow sensor. It will run at the factory defaults; however your gas mileage will be back. I would recommend replacing it since your vehicle is running lean (not enough oxygen to the fuel ratio) considering your lack of acceleration. Do you have idling problems? If your car runs better WITHOUT the Maf sensor plugged in, than that's a sure way to know the MAF is bad.

Maybe someone could give me advice on what is wrong.
Oh I should mention the truck turns over but won`t start.
Thank you 
>>DeZe|||Answer||| I reckon your injector is leaking. I would do a fuel injector leakdown test, hook up a fuel pressure gauge to your fuel rail. Cycle the key from off to run to pressurize/prime the fuel system then back from run to off. Watch the fuel pressure gauge for a drop in pressure to rule out a leaky injector. You can also if you do not have a fuel pressure gauge just lift your fuel rail and injectors out of their holes and turn your key to the on position this will pressurize/prime the fuel system and you can visually see if your injector is leaking(look for fuel drippling out.) 
For your cranking but not start issue, check for spark and check fuel pressure. Smack the bottom of your fuel tank to give your fuel pump some loving that may be the concern but start with checking fuel pressure.
Hope this helps 
>>>Title||| Ford Torino 351c 4bbl
>>john.coxiii1016|||Original question||| I'm not very mechanically inclined so hopefully you guys can help, I have a 4dr 1970 ford torino w/ 351c 4 barrel carb and I want to switch it to a 2 barrel for better fuel economy, do y'all have any opinions as to which brand I should buy and how I would install? I appreciate the help guys n gals.
Thanks,
&quot;If your not FIRST your LAST!!!&quot; -Reese Bobby 
>>mechhound|||Followup-question||| If your Torino is running and performing properly with the current 4 barrel carburetor, and you drive sensibly, I doubt you'll gain much if any fuel economy. In fact my high school shop teacher told us a 4 barrel carburetor would give better fuel economy because the primary carb jets could be smaller because you had the other 2 barrels when you really needed power. 
  What kind of highway gas mileage are you currently getting? 
>>MagicRat</span>|||Followup-question||| I totally agree..... virtually all 4 bbl carbs run on only 2 barrels, unless you really stick your foot in it. As noted above, often these 2 barrels are slightly smaller than the barrels found in a 2 barrel carb, resulting in better fuel economy for average driving.  
The carb on this car should be an Autolite (Fords own design) and they were an excellent carb for day-to-day driving. 
You are much better served by giving this car a really sharp tune -up by a mechanic who knows what they are doing with 40++ year old systems. 
The ignition timing, advance curve, spark duration (dwell) and carburetor mixture are all mechanically -controlled and adjustable. Its easy for one or more of these controls to go out of adjustment, and kill the fuel mileage. 
Furthermore, several critical parts, such as the ignition points -and- condensor have a relatively short life (about 10,000 miles or less). They are cheap and pretty easy to install, but if they are neglected, the car runs poorly and won't pass a gas station.

>>>Title||| resetting brake switch/valve
>>jakegday|||Original question||| Hello all.  The rear brake line on my 81 fairmont rusted out the other day. I replaced it, then bled both rear brakes. the pedal still didnt feel right so i decided to bleed the front brakes too. the master cylinder is split into 2 sections. 1 section holds fluid for the front brakes, the other section holds fluid for the rear brakes.  While bleeding all 4 tires, fluid came out of the section for the rear brakes only.  Throughout all 4 tires.  No fluid at all came out of the side for the front tires (the bigger side). There is absolutely no air in the system, and the brake pedal still doesnt feel as good as it did last week. 
Im assuming the valve/switch (pressure differential switch maybe?) thing underneath the master cylinder is the culprit, i just dont know how to &quot;fix&quot; it. 
Can anyone help?
i wanted to add: the master cylinder was replaced last summer, the brake light on the dash has not illuminated once through any of this, and i have confirmed that all 4 tires do lock up when the brake pedal is pressed..

>>VTHockey11|||Original question||| My fiancee was driving her 2009 Ford Focus home from work when her Engine Light came on. The engine began rumbling, and within a couple of miles, seized. 
She had it towed to her dealership where they held the car for over 24 hours before delivering a verdict on the issue, saying the engine seized due to a missing oil filter and would need to be replaced for $6,500. 
She asked how the oil filter could go missing about 3000 miles after her last oil service/check-up at their dealership and the guy said, &quot;It was stolen.&quot; 
I've looked up and down the internet and haven't found one person who had their oil filter stolen.
Is there any means of stealing an oil filter without breaking into the car? And furthermore, is it of any value? Why would someone steal one?
My belief is that the mechanic put the wrong filter in and it eventually fell out due to being the wrong size and as a result, we are going to fight for them to replace the engine at their expense. Is this a fair conclusion? Has anyone ever experienced a stolen oil filter? 
Thanks!

>>clatescivicr|||Original question||| Hey guys, I use to be a very active member years back, but I have been quite busy and started to get away from cars. I need to pick up a couch and the person believes it is 6 feet counting the armrests. I'm going to be borrowing my friends 2004 escape and was wondering if we could fit it in there? I don't have a problem pulling seats if we have to. The thing is, I need to find out by tomorrow afternoon to tell the person holding it. Any input would be greatly appreciated!!! 
>>MagicRat</span>|||Answer||| Well, as I am in the furniture business, let me help. 
The length is not the problem. Some sofas can be quite tall, or deep (front to back) and simply will not fit. An 'antique' style sofa will not be a problem, but an modern overstuffed style likely won't go. 
If it does fit, a 6 ft sofa will hang out the back 1 to 2 feet depending on the size of the arms. This is okay, since you can drive with the hatch open. Just open the side windows and be careful of the exhaust fumes getting inside. 
The hazard here is rear end collisions. Even a modest rear end collision can push the sofa forward, and could potentially shove the drivers seat forward and kill/injure you. 
IMO rent/borrow a trailer. It's safer. 
>>clatescivicr|||Answer||| Thanks for the help. I ended up not getting it since the weather was bad and the person was moving the next morning. The couch wasn't worth renting a trailor as the escape doesn't have a hitch on it.

>>denisond3|||Followup-question||| Its not clear to me what you want to do.  I presume this is a Ford based motorhome (which might have a title issued by the body maker Shasta, or by Ford, the chassis maker) ...and that you want to register it where you live?
     When I bought my 1972 Winnebago I took the 'signed off' title from the prior owner, went to the local Division of Motor Vehicles (in my residence state of Virginia), got a title in my name, and license plates for it.  I just needed an insurance verfication, my driver's license, and proof that I was in the state legally (not an illegal immigrant).  
  Then it took me four months of working every evening and each weekend to get it in shape for a 2200 mile vacation drive.  
   You might want to go to .  You have to join to post questions, but its free.
Evert jurisdiction is likely to be somewhat different.  In VA you just show them the title.  In TX to license a vehicle that is from out of state, you much get the vehicle to an inspection station, where they give you a form verifying that the VIN on the vehicle matches the title, and that the vehicle really exists.  
P.S.  In my view, the most serious problem with a motorhome that old is typically that the brakes need attention; they may be stuck on or stuck off, or dragging and or leaking.

>>truckvan|||Original question||| My 1991 Ford E250 Truck 3 / 4 ton Van 5.8L Windsor FL 8, does not pull  backward or forward. The transmission stopped working while driving at a  speed of 40 mph, the engine starts well, and check the terminals of the  solenoid valve body of the transmission, which gives me a reading of  20.4 ohms in four solenoids (shift solenoid1 , shif solenoid 2,  converter clutch solenoid control, coast clutch solenoid) and 4.5 ohms  in the remaining solenoid (electronic pressure control solenoid). But  look at the problem here: the terminals of the sensor (sensor  transmission oil temperature), which is integrated with solenoid valve  body, gave me an open reading, is actually a thermistor and if in good  or not very good condition should give me at least read ohms.

>>joemffields|||Answer||| Your tire sensor is prolly going off because the pressure in one or more of your tires is incorrect, check the recommended psi and correct it, it should tell in the owners manual, and you might have to reset the sensor, also should tell in the owners manual. Your oil sensor could be going off because of too high of pressure, to low of pressure, or that it's time to change it, if you have already changed it and it's still on then you might have to reset it, also should tell in the owners manual. As for your door sensor, check and make sure all of the door are shut securely, if that doesn't work you might be getting a bad connection with one of the door sensors. make sure they are connected, check for cut or damaged wires in and around all of your doors. hope that helps

>>hungarian_boss|||Original question||| My Ford 500 has been starting to shake when braking.
At first I thought it was the front pads and rotors, so I replaced the entire front w/new pads, and rotors.
Didn't fix the problem.
Then, just this wkend I changed my rear pads. I checked the runout for both back rotors, and they were both within .005&quot; so I know for a fact, they aren't warped. I knocked any rust off the perimeter.
All calipers are working fine (front and back), as far as I can tell.
Steering wheel shakes alittle, not much. The shaking is much more noticeable through out the car as opposed to the steering wheel. And i'm not feeling a pulse through the brake pedal.
I'm stumped. I've tried everything I can think off. I just wanted to get some other opinions before I take it to a garage and pay just to be told whats wrong. 
>>oldblu65|||Followup-question||| Generally a problem ( on the front of your car ) will be felt in the steering wheel as it shakes , vibrates , etc. so I suspect your problem is at the rear of your car . Have you had your tires checked  ( balance as well as a possible slipped belt inside the tire ) ?  Might have a bent wheel ,  a loose u - joint , loose shock , just a multitude of possibilities . Check all the bolts and nuts under the car and make sure all are tight and you haven't had something come loose and fall off . It is frustrating , I know ! Good luck !

>>>Title||| Fired needing new motor
>>sassygrrl32aa|||Original question||| This is about my 2001 ford taurus with 174,000 miles.
I take my car into the dealership because the check engine light was on. They said it was the coil pack and did a tuneup while there. I drive the car off the lot, go about thirty miles from home. As far as I can see it's driving fine. I get to my destination and notice a misfire(like it's skipping), finally the engine light comes back on before I get home. I take it back to the dealership the next day. Several days go by and I don't hear from them so I finally go when I need to get something out out of it. They tell me it needs a new engine. The service advisor tells me the oil rings and pistons are shot and it's 60% low on one cylinder and 40% low on another cylinder. Compression, that is. I talk to the tech who tested the car and he tells me it's 80 psi across the board except that one cylinder(cylinder 2) which is misfiring. It's lower, don't remember how much.
I give them my warranty information. I wait another few days and call them again and the service advisor tells me he's still waiting on the warranty company so I call and find out no one has called about the claim so either this advisor doesn't know what he's doing or he out and out lied.
Either way, I paid over $700 for the repairs and if they had told me the engine needed replacing beforehand I could have saved myself the money. They should have tested the compression while the spark plugs were out(at least that's what I've been told).
I had one incident the week before while climbing a steep mountainous grade doing about 70 mph and in cruise. Suddenly the rpm's shot way up and I lost power a few moments later. The CEL was flashing. I got the car to the side of the road and it was idling roughly. I turned it off and back on again and it was fine and went up the mountain fine and no cel light.. A few days later the engine light came on but it was still running okay. That's when I took it in.
Honestly, I thought it was the fuel injector because about a year ago it did almost the same exact thing and that's what it was.
I've always done the maintenance, flushes, fuel injector cleaning, oil changes(5000 miles) when it needed it, every 30,000 miles like they recommend.
I feel like the car should have done more.
As soon as I can I'm taking it to another shop.
It's hard for me to believe that a Ford dealership is that haphazard. It's under new ownership now(never had a problem before new owner) and all the techs that were there before have left.
Confused and would like to make sense of this. I just got back from a long trip in the car, no problems and the miles are mostly highway. Tech said it didn't matter. One other thing, the service advisor said because the spark plugs were getting old that that led to the engine failure.
Thanks in advance. 
>>sassygrrl32aa|||Answer||| Oh, the last time out it was low about a quart of oil, 5000 miles. I drove it 3000 and it lost maybe a half quart.

I use synthetic blend oil. 
>>big white bufflo|||Answer||| i would take it another repair shop for a second opinion it sound like a run around to me 
>>sassygrrl32aa|||Followup-question||| I've already taken it to another shop. They did a compression test and all the cylinders were fine except that one cylinder(number 2) which is at 40 psi.
Today, they are going to do the leakdown test and examine the rocker arms, etc. The tech believes it needs a valve job. They will get back to me this afternoon with the results of their findings.
From, there I can decide to do the repairs or not and find out of the warranty company will cover the repairs. I'll find out if the warranty company will cover it, of course.

This car looks, from a distance, to be in shambles. Upon closer inspection, it's actually solid, with one rust hole the size of a golf ball in the passenger side floorpan. The &quot;Spring green&quot; is a pretty solid patch of surface rust, and the driftwood color is getting to be that way itself. Interior needs alot of upholstry work. On the flipside, the car has all four of the original wheels, all of the chrome and hubcaps. It does not appear to have the factory ac unit. All of the plastic-lensed lights are there and complete.
All of the electrics seem operational. 
Clear title, original keys, brakes work, glass is unmolested and door/window seals are in reasonably good condition. Odometer shows 38,xxx and the State of Kansas (along with the previous owner's insurance compay) that this is true and accurate. One owner. What's this thing worth??? Can't find anyone that has a clue what an Edsel is, let alone what it's worth.

>>>Title||| 78 ranchero loose steering
>>jakegday|||Original question||| hello all, just picked up a 1978 ranchero, and the steering wheel seems very loose.  lots of play in it.   any ideas what this could be? 
>>denisond3|||Followup-question||| As far as I recall, a 78 would have had a conventional layout, with a steering box at the forward end of the steering column.  That steering box would normally be out of adjustment after as little as 20,000 miles, and further out after more mileage - unless it had been adjusted, which seldom happened.
   And assuming there is a hydraulic actuator (hydraulic piston goody) that shoves the cross steering tube back and forth, see if the joint where the actuator connects to that lateral tube, or where the actuator is connected to the subframe, has any play in it.   On a 77 Granada I had to replace the joint at one end of the cross steering tube, after about 80,000 miles.
Adjusting the steering box may require the thing to be removed from the car, but only due to the adjustments being inacessible when its still on the car; I just dont remember that.
  The adjustment itself consists of First; adjusting the bearing preloading for the steering shaft, and Secondly; adjusting the preloading of the pitman arm.   Once you have done this successfully on any steering box from that era, you know how to do it for all of them.   If the steering box was off the car, the adjustments would make the steering shaft stiff enough (due to the preloading), that you would need pliers to rotate it.  If its way out of adjustment, it will take more than one 're-adjustment', while the surfaces of the sector gear and the 'travelling ball nut' inside the steering box wear back to a nice contact pattern.
On a GM car, the steering box would have needed the same adjustments, but GM used the Saginaw steering boxes having the hydraulic actuators built into them.   I think Ford steering boxes just had the hydraulic valves in the steering box, with external actuator pistons.  
With both systems, it wasnt unusual to have 3 or 4 inches of movement of the steering wheel rim, before the car would be responding.  With proper adjustment, that should be totally gone, and -Any- sllight movement of the steering wheel rim should result in a slight change to the track of the car.  And it should be easy to keep it in the narrowest traffic lane.
There could also be play at the outer tie rod ends, where they connect to the steering arm on the spindle.  Also normal balljoint wear will decrease the toe-in, until there is actually some toe-out.  This will contribute to a mushy wandering feeling in steering.   Adjusting toe-in isnt high tech, but really really makes a difference in how crisp the steering feels.  It will also help to counter-act any tendency for the tire treadwear to happen on the inner side of the tread more than the outer side.
good luck....

>>>Title||| Steel Seal Sealer
>>libraflo|||Original question||| I have a friend who has 2 ford Taurus cars, a 2001 and 2004 I think. He has a small leak which is down in an area near the freeze plug on the passenger side. I have seen videos which claim a sealer named steel seal is very effective on small engine coolant leaks.  It is very expensive and is only sold through their on line site as far as I can determine. Have any of you guys had any direct experience with it or know someone who has and was it effective? 
>>danielsatur|||Answer||| I have used Metallic Block seal for leaky freeze plugs, it's alot cheaper.
There's some good videos on youtube about steel seal,they clam it has a guarantee or money back.
I have heard Mechanics using Blue Devil stop leak @ the Auto parts store. 
>>Tony Silva|||Followup-question||| I've tried the &quot;steel seal&quot;...it is a crappy product!!! 
Never tried metallic Block.
But I have used these one freeze plugs that are kinda hard to explain what they are.....basically, 2 big flat washers with a rubber hardening seal in between them...you put the assembly in the empty freeze plug hole then tighten the nut in the center...squishing the washers ...causing the rubber to swell in diameter...did it a few times...never had one leak. 
>>>Title||| Chugging in Gear
>>gcurtis79|||Original question||| We have a Ford Windstar with a 3.8L V6 2001. Got it from a dealership 4 months ago. It stalled the first time I started it after paying for it, but then it started right up and was fine. It was fine for a long time but now has other issues.
Once started, the engine revs high for about 15 seconds, then slows down. When sitting idling, the engine is running rough, and the tach bounces between 1000 and 1500. It stalls after running for a couple of minutes in park while idling quite often.
When put into gear, it starts chugging, like a high/low/high/low kind of surging at regular intervals. When the engine is under load, it's backfiring (light pops, some barely noticeable), and when stopped at a light, it goes back to chugging.
We've changed the feul filter, plugs, and wires, but not sure which avenue to follow here, as we're kind of strapped for cash, and if it isn't the fuel pump, then I don't want to run out and buy one. No check engine light comes on.
If anyone has some insight, I would really really appreciate it. It's been running like this for 2 months now, and has given me some rather uncomfortable moments, so I need to get it fixed.
Thanks for taking the time to read.

>>>Title||| slow cranking 351w
>>TonyMadrid|||Original question||| I have a hotrod with a 351W and an AOD trans. Last year, at the end of our cruisin season, the engine began giving me cranking problems. It would crank really slow at times (whether it was cold or hot). I checked my battery and it was strong and fully charged. I then installed an aftermarket starter but the problem persisted. This season I installed a Powermaster high torque starter and it seemed to solve the problem, but only momentarily as the problem began again. However this time the starter will sometimes just spin (free wheel) without engaging the flex plate. I have to turn the engine at the crank pulley with a wrench and then it will crank and start.
I pulled the flexplate inspection cover and examined the teeth and they were all intact.
I have checked all wiring and cable contact points to insure good connections and good grounding. I have even replaced the starter solenoid.
The problem is still present.
One thing that I did notice is that when the starter free-wheels and I have to turn the engine by hand, it seems very difficult to turn. The engine is not a high-compression setup and I know it should offer some resistance as the plugs are still in, but from experience it does seems much too much difficult to turn by hand.
It seems that there is something causing the excessive resistance and not allowing the engine to turn freely and start. I don't think it is anything internal, i.e., timing chain, crank, rod, or cam bearings as I would think any issues such as those would have been noticeable with either noise and/or performance. However, once running, the engine runs fine and performs well
Yesterday while at a cruise, one of the guys mentioned that he had heard of slow cranking situations that were caused by torque converter and/or flex- plate problems.
Today I am planning on pulling the plugs and see how that impacts hand cranking. I also plan on separating the trans from the engine to see if there are any obvious flexplate or converter issues and while separated see if the engine hand cranks easily.
Any thoughts or help would be greatly appreciated.

>>>Title||| Ford Fusion 2010
>>mdawg25|||Original question||| Hello, I am currently looking for a car and have been heavily weighing a 2010 Ford Fusion. The Ford dealer that it's at is offering it at 19,000 dollars after trade in. It's 23,500 miles approximately. It comes with heated seats, sunroof, sirus radio and a 100,000/6year warranty. It also has a V6 engine. It is the SEL model. Do you guys think it would be a good buy? 
>>Willyum|||Followup-question||| Don't expect a decision from the info you have provided.  Have you had it seriously looked over by an impartial person who knows what to look for?  Like has it had any body work or repainting done?  The overall condition?  We didn't learn what you were trading in so we can't do the math.  
In the end, it is a personal choice but I would seriously consider getting a new one figured out as well. 
>>mdawg25|||Answer||| Sorry, I'm trading in a Dodge Intrepid, year 2000. It has 125,000 miles on it and they are giving me approximatel 500 dollars on the car. The Fusion has no body work done on it or no previous paint job. You're right though haha. Everyone I ask about the car says that it is up to me and a personal choice. I've done enough homework on the car to decide that it is a really good car. The only thing scaring me at this point is that I've heard it has had transmission problems. Thanks for your assistance anyway.

>>>Title||| Transmission Shudder????
>>turfmanager|||Original question||| I have a 2003 F150,v-6 automatic. 275,000 miles on it, 80% of those are highway miles. As it warmed up today (the temperature outside), my truck would shudder and make a popping noise and not want to shift. Yesterday, and all winter it did not do this, however as it did warm up on certaindays, it would get kind of testy and shudder a little.  I checked the fluid level and its a little high but not burnt smelling. I'm going to drain the system, and vacuum the remaining fluid out from the top (17 qts total!!) and change the filter. I service my vehicle regularly, so I'm not sure if I missed something or its time to get my transmission rebuilt. Could it simply be warmer weather and too much fluid? Is it my torque converter getting ready to fly out of the tranny? is it time to go and get a junkyard tranny and suck it up? Any suggestions? 
>>kevinande|||Answer||| If you have been regularly servicing the fluid in the transmission, it could simply be deposits in the torque converter.  Before I spent money on a new tranny new or junk yard I would spend the $150 at the dealer for a flush and see if that helps at all.  If these symptoms just started, there is a good chance you will be fine after a flush, but there are no guarantees.  275,000 is pretty impressive, they usually will not make it that far unless they have been properly maintained!

>>>Title||| 4.6L &quot;light load&quot; misfire
>>Blue)(Fusion|||Original question||| I  have a &quot;light load&quot; misfire ranging from about 20-50MPH.  It happens  in 3rd and OD gears when the RPMs and load are low.  It is not torque converter  shudder.  I checked and rechecked.  It does not present itself when idle  or at heavy loads.  When I get on the gas hard, the engine makes plenty  of power and doesn't miss a beat.  But when maintaining speed on a flat  road, this is extremely annoying.
I changed the spark plugs in  March which did not help any.  I cleaned the COP boots and springs and  applied generous amounts of dielectric grease which did not change  anything.  I checked for vacuum leaks, it's at 20&quot; Hg when idle and  steady as a rock.
When I disconnect the EGR vacuum solenoid it  DOES go away.  However, this leaves the engine running lean, EGTs hot,  and stores a code for the EGR solenoid circuit which illuminates the  CEL.
I removed the DPFE multiple times and tapped the moisture  out of it.  The hoses are connected correctly and the electrical  connection on firmly.
When I apply vacuum to the EGR valve, it  opens, I can hear exhaust gas flowing through it, and the engine nearly  dies and then re-trims itself to a near-normal idle.
It has been  around for over a year and I want to get rid of it once and for all.  It  seems to be getting worse in the warmer weather.
This is on a MY2000 4.6L in a Grand Marquis, by the way. 
>>way2old</span>|||Followup-question||| Hey Blue.  Have a scan tool that can read mode $06 data and see which cylinder has the misfire.  A lot of times the coil boots will arc through the center to the heads.  If there are small cracks on the boot bottom they can misfire also. 
>>Blue)(Fusion|||Followup-question||| I used my laptop to read $06 misfire data and gave me nothing.  I also forgot to mention that about a year ago when this problem first started, I bought all new boots and springs for the COPs and this did not change anything.
In your opinion, would a problematic COP be responsible for this?  It just seems weird that it happens during light load and not at idle or high loads. 
>>Blue)(Fusion|||Followup-question||| For what it's worth, I've been digging more around the internet.  It seems alot of people who have this error do infact have some sort of weak coil/COP or an MAF issue.
I checked my MAF readings in drive and neutral idles and the values seemed higher than what they should have.  However since this is a Motorcraft 80mm MAF used on trucks and Mustangs, I can't say for sure that this is the problem.  The readings I was TOLD I should get is around 0.65v in drive idle.  I am getting 0.915v in drive idle.
I asked my tuner to see if this is expected and taken account for in his tune.
In addition, I also opted to get a set of 8 Accel COPs from Amazon.  I know they don't increase power or efficiency as some people claim., but they were a good deal and I am uncertain that my old, tired COPs are the problem or not and want to eliminate more possibilities. 
>>way2old</span>|||Followup-question||| We have run into many COP that will cause an intermittent misfire under light load.  If you have a friend that has a Ford IDS or a scope that can look at the ignition firing you can pinpoint it.  The IDS has a power balance feature that compares each cylinder.  A weak coil shows up very clearly. 
>>Blue)(Fusion|||Followup-question||| Unfortunately I don't have a friend with the IDS.  My software could probably do it but I'd have to know the actual HEX command to send via the console as there is no &quot;click and do&quot; option to perform it.  That's how I got the Mode $06 data.
It may be a mute point anyway.  Amazon is being amazing as the new COPs are estimated to arrive at my house tomorrow (ordered only this morning)!
I will update once I get them installed and do some test driving. 
>>Blue)(Fusion|||Followup-question||| I have the new Accel SuperCoils COPs installed.  After an initial test drive, everything seems so far so good.  I was trying varying throttle positions and loads and no miss!  I did not drive it long enough to fully relearn the fuel trims and whatnot yet (I reset the ECU KAM by disconnecting the battery), so it is not yet a sure thing.
But here are some pictures.
Before
The new versus the old
After
For anyone else interested in aftermarket COPs, these are Accel 140032 Super Coils and work with most (if not all) 2 valve Ford 4.6L and 5.4L engines that use Coils-On-Plugs.  Kit of 8 + shipping for under $200 vs. Motorcraft costs close to $500 on average.  I have nothing against the Motorcraft coils, but this was the best cost effective solution for me. 
>>Blue)(Fusion|||Answer||| Unfortunately, this did not fix the issue.
I also replaced my HO2 sensors with Motorcraft OEM ones I had laying around to see if that helped.  They also did not change anything.

>>slick_9191|||Original question||| Hi All,
First post. So I got my first non-sportscar, non-standard tranny, non-two door car... and I need to know how to drive it.
Just kidding, kinda. Being used to driving standards I do three things by nature to my (new/2010) automatic transmission:
1. When cruising on a downhill or when I'm going to come to a stop, I put the car in neutral and keep it there until I'm ready to go again, then engage.
2. When 'engaging' to (D)rive, I don't press on the brakes, I just slip it from (N)eutral down to (D) and let it start rolling. I assume this releases some pressure from the automatic trans when it engages, prolonging its life... correct me if I'm wrong.
3. Basically is ok to drive this way, attempting to increase my MPG and prolong the life of my tranny.
Thanks in advance guys. 
>>Knifeblade|||Followup-question||| Actually, auto trans are very reliable, and are built to take into account a constant D engagement.
I don't think it really matters that much re mpg, if it does, you wouldn't see any noticable savings for quite awhile over just keeping the trans in D constantly.
One thing I strongly suggest is to ALWAYS foot on brake when engaging the trans from P or N into D or R.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Consider the movement that is stopped, could save nicking someone's rear end, or keep you from nosing out into a street where you get smacked from oncoming traffic. Or keep the rear of your car from clipping an old lady trundling her shopping cart behind you in your blind spot in a parking lot.  Just a few examples. 
>>slick_9191|||Answer||| 
Quote:
>>Knifeblade|||Answer||| Well, Steve, there's nothing wrong with going into D from N freely, if you are .  It, IMO, really will make little difference, except maybe on a trans that hasn't been maintained or has major miles on it.

*No towing and driven mostly in city*
First Problem
January 5th, 2011 @ 1:00 pm: Traveling up-hill on at 40-50 mph. During
acceleration, SUV had a simultaneous jerk/loud clunk which felt like begin “hit
from behind”, “axel locked up” or “engine/transmission dropping out”. This happed two times within a 5 second period. Pulled over and shut SUV off. Re-started SUV after checking fluid levels and ran normal.
Weather Conditions: Wet and raining / 40-45 degrees
Road Conditions: Smooth blacktop / uphill
SUV Conditions: During acceleration between 40-50 mph / after running at normal temp (45 min)
Second Problem
Tuesday, January 11th, 2011 @ 4:30 pm: Traveling home from work at 25-35 mph. SUV had a simultaneous jerk/loud clunk which felt like begin “hit from behind”, “axle&quot; locked up”, or “engine/transmission dropping out”. This happed two times within a 3 second period, and the TRACTION CONTROL light blinked 3 times. RPM climbed as if it were in neutral but then “grabbed” and drove normal.
Weather Conditions: Wet and raining / 35-40 degrees
Road Conditions: Smooth blacktop / flat surface SUV Conditions: During acceleration between 25-35 mph / after running at normal
temp (15-20 min)
Third Problem
Sunday, January 16th, 2011 @ 7:15 pm: Traveling to gas station (4 miles) and felt one hard clunk with a simultaneous jerk. SUV paused but then drove normal. Traction control blinked once. Filled up gas tank and began to drive home. While driving uphill at 25-35 mph, SUV had an extreme loud clunk/jerk which threw me into the steering wheel and almost stopped the SUV immediately. SUV lost DRIVE and began to roll back down the hill in reverse while still in gear (drive) and while pressure was still on the accelerator. RPM’s showed 4000. I hit the brakes and put in park; got out to see if anything fell off the engine but no sign of parts or fluid. Returned to SUV and put back into DRIVE and hit accelerator. RPM’s increased but SUV rolled backwards again. I pushed brake and put into LOW gear; hit accelerator and SUV continued to roll backwards while RPM’s increased. Pushed brake and put SUV into REVERSE, which did work. Drove in reverse with flashers on down the hill and
then spun around in reverse, and went back up in reverse (.3 miles to home).
Returned home and waited for tow-truck. When tow-truck arrived (45 minutes later) we put the SUV in DRIVE and noticed it worked once again. Was told by towing company to not take chances and have towed to Wilson Motors of Corvallis, Oregon.
Weather Conditions: Wet and raining / 55-60 degrees

>>serge_saati|||Answer||| It really looks like a transmission issue. Like if a gear inside the transmission is randomly blocked and prevent randomly the transmission to move in forward motion. I'm pretty sure it's not a problem with center shaft. As long as you drive only at right lane on highways until the problem is diagnosed and repaired, you should be ok.

>>>Title||| Ford Edge key
>>tleeburks|||Original question||| Here is my situation.  My wife slipped on the ice at Walmart last night (Im gonna deal with them this morning), unfortunately her keys fell out of her purse and we cant find the key which is the one with the remote in it.  So I need to know where to get another one at, where do I take it to get it cut and can I buy instructions on how to reprogram it.  Also, the one I have left for some reason stopped opening and closing the doors on the remote.  Could it be the battery?  Can i replace the batteries and will it work again?  Please help.  thanks. 
>>tleeburks|||Followup-question||| well i found the key at customer service at walmart.  however,  my personal key doesnt activate the doors remotes, my wife's found keys do.  so how can i check to see if the batteries are low, how do i take this apart?  it would be cheaper for the battery replacement instead of the reprogramming.  thanks 
>>denisond3|||Followup-question||| I dont have an Edge or any car that new, but most of those remotes can be pried open by twisting a dime in the grooves at one edge.  The battery may or may not be low, but I would buy a new battery of the same 'number' anyway.
  And you should ask the dealer, and at a locksmiths, to see what it takes to get another key to work with your car.  It can be expensive, so you might want to know about it.  The owners manuals used to have some instructions about changing batteries in remotes.
Good Luck.  I like cars old enough to have simple metal keys - but usually I have to tow them home, rebuild the engines/transmissions - in order to be able to rely on them for daily drivers.

I've changed my alternator twice to swap it out, and tried multiple different terminal to post connections, as you can see, it might be wrong, but i can't find anything i can understand on how to hook it up.
and i can't pull a voltage over 12.7, and thats not running. running the highest i've gotten was 12.3 i think? i've had everything tested by oriellys and autozone both, and they can't find the problem. i'm completely dumbfounded, and this is my last call for help before i take it to the shop.
things i've done:
alternator change (x2)
voltage reg
battery terminals (i cleaned them)
checked the ground to the block
checked belts
removed power to radio
revved engine
still no alternator power?
helpppppp 
>>Selectron|||Followup-question||| Hi, welcome to the forum. I don't know anything about your vehicle but I had a look at the wiring diagram on the Autozone website (Repair Info section). If the diagram is correct (sometimes they aren't; especially on older vehicles) then you have a fusible link in the alternator's main output feed to the battery. If you have a multimeter then it's easy to check the fusible link even if you don't know where it's located. With the engine off and the ignition also switched off, check for 12 volts on the alternator's main output terminal - that's the heavy gauge black wire which connects to the stud with the red plastic insulator on the right of your photo. Multimeter set to measure DC volts, black meter probe connected to a good ground point, and use the red meter probe to probe that output stud - if you have 12V on the stud then the fuse is intact, but if not then the fuse is open-circuit. That would be the obvious first check.
This is the wiring diagram - alternator at bottom left of page: . And remember you have both the engine and ignition switched off while doing that. 
>>MagicRat</span>|||Answer||| You have an external voltage regulator. If it is bad, the alternator will not work even if its good/new.

>>outdoorman|||Original question||| The family has 4 automobiles-Ford Bronco, crown victoria, toyota sienna and saturn SL2; not to mention  Son's 4 stroke dirtbikes.  Upto now, I have 3 diff viscosities of motor oil- 5w30, 10w40,5w20 between the cars.  My question is how important is it to stay with the manufacture recommended viscosity? I live in Georgia where the temps rarely get below freezing but does get up in the high 90s during the hot summers.

>>Davescort97</span>|||Followup-question||| Sure, I think 10w-40 would be all right since it never gets very cold where you live. The 5w-30 and the 5w-20 are gas saving viscosities. You may get a little less miles per gallon in the Sienna and the SL-2. The heavier oil causes internal drag, but it would hardly be measurable. How about some input from out there. Would the heavier oil hurt his fuel mileage? What about wear and tear on the engines? Would it be better to just use 5w-30 in all his vehicles?

>>>Title||| VX-6 Battery Additive
>>Davescort97</span>|||Original question||| I was thumbing through the J.C. Whitney catalog the other day and came upon this battery additive. It says it's liquid Cadmium. I know Cadmium is used in small rechargable batteries. It claims that if you leave your lights on and run down the battery you can start your car if you turn the lights off for 15 minutes and then try to start it again. What do you folks think about this? Is this stuff bad for the battery in any way? Think it will do what they claim?
I've been having trouble with the + battery terminal corrosion. I clean it off and then within a matter of weeks the corrosion comes back. Is there a solution for this? 
>>MagicRat</span>|||Followup-question||| I came across this thread:
Also, I bought a reconditioned battery from a place in Cambridge, Ont. From their description, they will take a battery that has sulphated plates (where it will not charge up nor discharge properly) .... but the plates are not actually warped or shorted out... then add this stuff to each cell. 
If its a sealed battery, like AC Delco, they will drill 6 tiny holes on top, inject the stuff into each cell then reseal the holes with epoxy. 
So far, the battery has worked very well for me. 
As for handling the stuff... if it really is cadmium, it is quite hazardous to handle. 
>>Davescort97</span>|||Answer||| Thanks much MagicRat. I think I will try it. 
>>Davescort97</span>|||Followup-question||| I got my order back from J.C. Whitney for the VX-6 battery additive.  I had to take some of the battery sulfuric acid out to make room for the VX-6. Right away I noticed that my lights were brighter at night. Also, my car is cranking up faster than it was before. The charging voltage went from 13.8 to 14.3 volts after adding the VX-6.  Only time will tell, if this stuff will really work out for me. It did say on the package that it wouldn't help sulfation which is contrary to what MagicRat posted. However, it seems like this stuff really works.  ~Dave~ 
>>eagleflyer|||Followup-question||| I bought &quot;VX-6&quot; from JC Whitney for many years.  My advice is do not wait until your battery will no longer charge.  When you get a new battery, immediately obtain this cadmium sulphate additive.  Pour 1/6 of a 2 oz bottle into each cell of a new 12 volt battery.  My experience has been that preventing the buildup of depositions on the plates can double the expected life of your battery.  JC Whitney still sells this product, but the product is now called &quot;Charge-It Concentrated Battery Additive&quot; by Solder-It (apparently the manf) at $10.99 for 2 oz or $25.99 for 1 qt (32 oz).  I once bought this product from Checker Auto under the brand name &quot;Instant ElectroStart&quot; by Victor, but apparently Victor went out of business or stopped manufacturing this product in 2000.  You won't find this product at Advance Auto or AutoZone or Checker any longer.  I think the computer geeks who plan the store layouts realized that selling what used to be a $5.00 product with a $2.00 markup that would double the life of a battery could not justifiably take up shelf space in competition with a battery they can sell for $100 with a $60 markup.  The big chains need to keep their shareholders happy by selling twice as many batteries.  Oddly enough, it occurs to me this is an example where socialist central planning might result in more efficient use of resources for all of us.  The old VX-6 boxes used to quote Lee Petty, Champion Nascar Winner, saying, &quot;I'd Rather Race Without Tires Than Without VX-6 In My Battery.&quot; 
>>Davescort97</span>|||Followup-question||| I have used the VX-6 additive now for a few months.  It says right on the package that the product will not extend life on a battery that has been sulfated. One day the battery just went dead. I tried a jump start and it would not stay running. I did have good luck with it up   to that point. I left my lights on for 2 hours and it started right up. It seems their claims are valid right up to the point that the battery is shorted out internally. This product will come through up until the plates are shorted out due to sulfation. I don't know if I want to use it again. It gave me no warning that the battery was about to expire. Luckily, for me I was at Wal-Mart and able to buy a new battery. The battery I had was 8 years old, so I imagine it was past its service life by 2 years. In view of this I have to go along with everyone else. It will extend the life of your battery. It just won't give you any advance warning when it decides to go out.

>>Davescort97</span>|||Answer||| If you can find the right buyer it could be worth upwards of $1000. Maybe $1500 if you can demonstrate that it runs.  The problem with an engine of this year is that it doesn't have hardened valve seats so it can't be run on unnleaded. An advantage of an engine of this vintage is that it doesn't have a computer and all of the sensors, hence it would be good engine to swap with a minimum of hassles. Appearance is everything.  Clean it up and paint the block Ford blue and use a high temperature coating for the headers. Run an ad in your local paper under parts and accessories. If it looks really good, ask $2000 for it.

The aftermarket control arms could be loose. Don't think the shocks would have any effect on it.  Can you put it up on a lift and check everything for loose parts or hardware that may have come loose. Given what you say, something is very wrong with your rear end. I'd take a big pry bar and check everything over. It would be best to jack it up under the tires or rear end so that it is like it would be going down the road. Check it out.

Have you replaced the PCV valve?  Checked it's hoses for leaks?  I think you need a new IAC (Idle Air Control) valve. It should be on top of the throttle body. It is a small electrical motor with a couple wires going into it. Take it off, clean it with carb spray and then lubricate the pintel with a couple drops of oil. If this doesn't take care of the problem you probably will have to get a new one. They aren't cheap.

>>Davescort97</span>|||Original question||| I recently ordered some tires for my Escort online.  They didn't have the Continentals I wanted but referred me to some cheaper tires. What do these tires numbers mean? The number on the sidewall is 185/65 R14 82H  VTQG 500 A-A for the Continentals and the numbers for the cheaper tires was 185/65 R14 82H VTQG 280 A-A for some Doral SDL all season radials. The maximum load limit on the Doral SDL tires is 1450 lbs at 57 psi. Wouldn't it be dangerous to run tires at 57 psi?  What pressure should I run in them?  The pressure is listed as 32psi. on a sticker on my door post. I know next to nothing about tires. Thanks Guys. 
>>Davescort97</span>|||Followup-question||| I did some checking. The 185 is the width of the tread in millimeters. 60 means the height of the sidewall is 60% of the tread width. The R means it is a radial tire and the 14 is the diameter of the rim in inches. The UTOG means universal tire grade. The 82 is the load factor and the H means it has a speed rating of 135. The 280 is the tread wear factor and denotes a tread life of 28,000 miles. The A A is the temperature rating of the tire. The Doral SDL tires a V in the tread design and will only rotate in one direction with the V pointing to the front of the car. The tires have some red dots on the sidewall only on one side. I wonder what that means. 
>>denisond3|||Followup-question||| If the maximum pressure listed on the sidewall is 57 psi, it means the tire was designed to handle that much pressure, while supporting 1450 lbs each while underway - so it should be safe, assuming the tire was not defective. (I dont associate such high sidewall 'max pressures' with -inexpensive- tires).   Carrying less weight per tire means that somewhat less air pressure is appropriate; but the weight/pressure relationship is NOT linear. Half as much weight on a tire does NOT go with half as much air pressure.
     The tire pressure listed on the sticker on your door is the pressure recommended by the manufacturer, for the tires that were on it when it was made; which are usually listed on the sticker too.  That lower pressure will give you a softer ride, but still be safe for any sane driving.  Maybe it was chosen by the legal staff to minimize product liability lawsuits?
   On my Escort I would use a tire pressure a little higher than 32, perhaps something like 40 to 44 psi.   A higher pressure will help with miles per gallon (but not tremendously).   The pressure for maximum tread-life seems to be higher than the pressures listed on the sticker on the door - but I have no clue how much higher.   The manufacturers cant help either, since &quot;best tread-life&quot; would vary depending on how much weight the tire was supporting &amp; the rim mounting width.  With higher pressures I think it is more important to rotate the tires periodically, due to pattern-wear happening on the rear tires.
     With 4 non-skinny adults riding in an Escort, I would guess the front tires carry about 900 lbs each, the rear tires about 800 lbs each.

 (I dont recommend anyone drive over the speed limits either).  I have confidence in my years of experience though, for dealing with my own cars.   
  When driving my vehicles, I Always check the tire temperatures each time we stop in a rest area, for gas, for meals, etc. - either by touching them with my hand or with an infra-red thermometer.
   I recommend everyone do this.  If one tire is warmer than the others - you need to learn why!  (The tires on the sunny side will be slightly warmer than the ones in the shade).   I check the air pressure in my tires more often than most folks - along with checking the brake fluid. 
>>Davescort97</span>|||Followup-question||| Thanks much for the information. It was put to good use in determining what tire pressure I will carry. That's a good idea to monitor the temp of the tires. If one was low on air or if the brake was dragging  it would increase the temp of the tire. OK the placard says 30 psi. That's too low for me. I am going to carry 35 psi. I'm not worrying too much about stopping distances beause I drive like an old man. Not that I am an old man. I acquired this habit when fuel was $3.55 a gallon here in Arkansas. Wasn't it odd that the price of gas went down just before the election.

>>MikeLantz|||Followup-question||| As an engineer I think it is criminal that the tire stores are so stupid to not understand the difference between pmetrics and old 32psi tires. At one time, all passinger tires were 32psi. Now 35 and 44 are common. Older door stickers are for the old non-pmetric 32psi tire. Putting 30psi in a 44psi tire severly underinflates it and was not what the car maker intended. Always use a ratio. If the older door sticker does not specify p-metrics, take the number and divide it by 32. 30/32 is 94%. If your tire is a 44psi unit, use 94% of 44 or 41psi. Never go below 80% of the tire max rating. I see too many tres reuined by tire stores that insist they must go by the door sticker and don't apply common sense.

>>>Title||| Short trip engine/oil abuse
>>Blue)(Fusion|||Original question||| I know, I know, short trips are bad on the oil, bad on the fuel, bad on lots of things.  But I can't help it much.  3 times a week minimum I have to drive to the airport for work which is only a mile away.  The temp doesn't even rise off the Hell-is-frozen-over-cold mark.  And then some hours later I have to drive back, although sometimes go grab some food which allows it to actually warm up some.
I just changed my oil last Saturday and checked it today when at the gas station.  You can easily tell there's moisture and fuel in it.  The big puff of smoke on startup is what prompted me to check, but I know that's because of the excess fuel in the cylinders because of it running rich in open-loop mode.
I just want to know if this is really really bad, or just marginally bad?  I try to atleast once a week take it out for a longer drive, say 10-15 miles or so to get it warmed up and burn some moisture out of the oil.  I just don't want my bearings wearing out for another 100k atleast.
If it matters, I use Motorcraft 5W-20 or 5W-30, whichever is available for 3,000 mile OCIs. 
>>RahX|||Answer||| Once in a while a short trip is ok. Repeated short trips really do the damage. If you can't help it, change your oil a lot more often. It doesn't make it better but it won't be as bad. 
>>Blue)(Fusion|||Followup-question||| Yeah I can't help but make these short trips (about a mile) to work and back these few times a week.  How often should I change it do you think?  3k is already pretty short considering new Fords are calling for 7.5k OCIs. 
>>MagicRat</span>|||Followup-question||| Imo older engines, with more blow-by will contaminate the oil faster. So, the older the engine is, the 'worse' it is, all other factors being equal. 
As for the change frequency...... change it every 3 months, regardless of how low the mileage is.  
>>Willyum|||Followup-question||| A puff of smoke on startup or after a long idle period usually is a sign of bad valve seals.  Shows up often on high mileage V-8s. 
>>Blue)(Fusion|||Followup-question||| Well only does it after those short trips.  I've been extending them to try to get the temp of the engine up a bit more which has helped.
I also believe the valve seal issue in the modular 4.6L engines were fixed in the '96 or '97 models.

>>jakegday|||Original question||| hello all, i recently bought a new (remanufactured) carb on ebay for my fairmont. i replaced it cuz the fast idle cam, along with the stud that holds it on, had fallen off the old one and disappeared.
with this new carburetor, in the morning time, after the engine has sat for 12+ hours in the freezing cold, it doesnt fire up nearly as quick as it used to. before it would crank for maybe 2-3 seconds then fire up. with this new carburetor you have to crank it for literally 10-15 seconds before it turns over. ive got the air/fuel adjusted as good as i can get it, from listening and feeling how it drives, i dont have any tools for that. The fast idle and normal idle are adjusted to my liking, once the engine is running.
before i would just get in the car, pump the gas once, then hold it at half throttle and start it, i do that now this happens...
any input would be most appreciated.... 
>>Davescort97</span>|||Answer||| The choke may not be fully closing.  Take the screws loose from the automatic chock heated  housing. When the engine is cold, rotate the choke housing until the choke fuly closes. Once the engine starts the vacuum operated choke pull off should be adjusted to  pull the choke off about 1/8 of an inch . 
>>denisond3|||Followup-question||| And if the choke is working okay, the problem could also be the fuel  is leaking out of the float bowl.  This can happen if a gasket or an O-ring has shriveled from age.   On some carbs the base gasket (the one in contact with the manifold) forms the bottom of fluid passages within the carb.  A bad base gasket could therefore let fuel escape - or air get in where it shouldnt.
  I have 2 cars that I really like (87 Dodge Omni 4 dr hatchbacks) that start just fine if used every day.  But if they sit longer it would take a LOT of cranking before they started. But if I dribble fuel into the float bowl; then they start immediately.  Both have carbs in them that were 'rebuilts' on ebay.  But they had been rebuilt many years before, &amp;  the seller finally got tired of having them in his inventory and put them up on ebay.  
     
I have also changed a couple of cars whose carbs had automatic chokes to have a manual choke cable.  This is because the spiral bimetallic spring inside the auto choke 'ages' and doesnt swing properly over a wide range of temperatures.  Since new cars dont use carbs anymore, its not likely replacement spiral springs will be available, like they were 20 years ago. 
>>>Title||| Accuracy of FORD.ENGINE.TORQUE_C
>>Blue)(Fusion|||Original question||| I was looking at a few different PIDs I can log with my PC and found this FORD.ENGINE.TORQUE_C PID. I logged it and it clearly logs the torque of the engine, but not sure how accurate/usable it is. I Was also wondering if this is calculated for the torque at the flywheel, trans, or wheels. The highest I've ever gotten it is 250ft-lb at WOT and around 5100RPMs (100% load in second gear). When in Park/Neutral, it reads 0 but when in gear and stopped, will read around like 5-10 ft-lbs which is why I was thinking this may be calculated at the trans.
Anyone know how this is calculated and what it may compare like with true dyno results?

>>rhandwor|||Followup-question||| Its a gas hog but should do what you want it to do transporting people.
Pay a mechanic to inspect the vehicle before purchasing. They have companies who do this in the Atlanta Ga. area.
Maybe you can use an independent shop. Have them pull all wheels and do a complete brake inspection. If you can afford it pay for a compression test.
Look for any codes if any light is staying on when driving. 
>>MagicRat</span>|||Answer||| Good advice. Get it checked out by a mechanic. That price is pretty low if the van is mechanically sound. 
For that low price, expect that some minor mechanical work may need to be done, such as brakes, filters, coolant hoses, oil change, tune up etc. 
But as noted above, you need to aviod a rusty frame/body, worn-out engines and bad transmissions. 
Otherwise, these vans are decent vehicles. They are solid, reliable, easy to maintain. Parts and service tends to be cheaper than new cars and trucks. 
Good luck.  
>>>Title||| old car egr help wanted!
>>pstrbrc|||Original question||| I'm working on a '78 LTD w/302 engine. Somewhere along the line all of the emissions stuff was removed from the engine, and a plate was put on the egr port. So, I'm trying to see what it would take to either install the complete system the way Henry built it, or at least put in a working rudimentary egr system. 
My first thought was to go to RockAuto.com and see what parts they listed, but they don't offer much beyond the egr valve itself. They don't even offer a vacuum thermal valve. If I remember my basics correctly, a basic system needs ported vacuum, a thermal valve, and the egr valve itself. Right? What else would I need for a basic system? 
>>danielsatur|||Followup-question||| Is'nt this car exempted from emission laws? 
>>Blue)(Fusion|||Answer||| Daniel may be right.  Before buying anything for emissions regulations, make sure it applies to your vehicle year in your county. 
>>MagicRat</span>|||Followup-question||| Old, mechanical EGR systems were complex and flawed, with many resulting drivability problems. Imo, unless its necessary for emissions compliance, adding an EGR system is an unnecessary expense and can open up a big can of worms regarding drivability, performance, stalling etc. 
Yes, its nice to have an all-original car, but older EGR systems are not helpful.

>>delizious|||Answer||| Jello,
I have a 1973 Ford Pinto Wagon and ever since I changed the valve seals and did the timing on the engine about 5 times and the valve lash two times I still have gas coming out of the carb. 
This engine is a 2000cc engine and gets 86hp with about 60,000 miles on it, I've had many people say that its eather the float in the carb, or my timing is 180 out and also that its the valve lash. Can someone please direct me in a 100 percent direction to go to, I know you guys can't see the car as I am seeing it but any positive for sure answer would help me right now.  
>>Davescort97</span>|||Original question||| Welcome to AF!
If gas is running out of the carb it is a fuel float problem. It should be set so that it is horizontal to the bowl. If it is gas spitting out of the carburetor while the engine is running it is either the timing  too retarded or the intake valves are leaking. It sounds like a timing problem to me. Have an associate keep the engine revved up while you turn the distributor to see if you can get it to run better. Find out where it is knocking and back it off a couple of degrees. 
To find out if it is the intake valves leaking put a vacuum gauge on the intake and check it for leaky valves. It it is a leaky valve the needle on the vacuum gauge will oscillate back and forth. 
Another way to check the intake valves for leakage is to run a compression check on the cylinders. If you have low compression and it is not remedied by a shot of oil in the spark plug hole, you have leaking valves.
I wish I was there to help you.  If i could only hear it run, I would have an answer for you pronto.  I hope you get her fixed. I haven't seen a Pinto for 10 years. 
>>delizious|||Followup-question||| Uhm yea...gas is spitting out while I try to ghetto rig the thing, I flipping lost the key and I have to start it from the solanoid! And when I do that it does not start completely, I don't get any turn over just gas spitting out of the carb. 
And thank you for welcoming me, I would of properly introduced myself but Im kind of in a hurry to get this thing over and done with. 
>>Torch|||Answer||| Gas flying up out of the carb throat means that the spark plug is trying to fire while the intake valve is open, either the valve is not completely closing or your timing is way, way, off or as someone else said 180 degrees off.
Try removing your distributor and moving the rotor until it is on the opposite side then reinstall it. 
>>johncasteel|||Answer||| well joust shorting the silinoid wont do the trick the ignition has to be twards the on point if not you wont get any spark and try takeing out your #1 cylander plug and hand turn the engine if you can to top dead center and then turne your distributer to about &quot;5 give or take a degre or two&quot; degres frome your spark then that should do the trick it works like a charm

I don't do any off-roading and it is still at stock height. I was looking at KYB Monomax shocks, and edelbrock IAS' at twice the price. Anyone have any suggestions/experiences. Thanks in advance 
>>Davescort97</span>|||Answer||| If you are looking for a comfortable ride witout too much shock action on a rough road I would suggest   going with a standard action shock. The standard  actiion shocks will give you a more comfortable ride on a rougher road, amd will result in better ride and control on a rough surface. 
>>Blue)(Fusion|||Answer||| I recommend using Motorcraft shocks, same as they came from the factory.  Next time I change my shocks I'm switching back to them.  They last double the mileage than anything else I've seen and are quite smooth.  If the shocks you have are original with 105k on them, then the replacements will smooth it out and get rid of the bounce. 
>>>Title||| heater doesnt get hot
>>jakegday|||Original question||| hello all.   im working with an 81 fairmont, 3.3L 6 cyl.  my problem is that my heater does not get hot.  it barely gets warm.  this is obviously after the engine has completely warmed up.  i turn the heater temp all the way up, i turn the fan switch to about 2 or 3,  and all i get is barely luke warm air.   if i turn the fan to speed 4,  the air becomes cool, almost cold.
i have replaced the thermostat and coolant.  im sure the water pump is fine....
the only thing i can think of that im gonna try today is getting behind the glove box and making sure that valve on the heater core is opening all the way,  other then that i have no ideas.   could the heater core just be bad?  or is this not a symptom of a bad heater core?? 
>>MagicRat</span>|||Followup-question||| Check the blend door.... good idea. 
I am not sure about your car, but many cars have a valve in the heater core line which closes off coolant flow to the core  unless the heater control is switched on. These valves are usually vacuum operated, so this switch (if it exists) might be stuck or the vacuum line is disconnected or not working. 
Also, the core might be clogged inside. 
First check: The next time the engine has fully warmed up, feel both heater core lines. They should feel as hot or hotter than the upper radiator hose. If they don't, then coolant flow is impared. If both heater lines are nice and hot, check the blend door. 
>>jakegday|||Answer|||

but still, even with my brand new heater core, both hoses do not match temperature.   the top radiator hose and the thicker heater core hose get hot, but the thinner heater core hose remains cold.  and, needless to say, my heater is still blowing cold
any suggestions?

Hissing sounded like it was coming from under the dash. also for a few days before this happened my idle has been slightly surging and I would smell raw fuel and the engine would stall after a few surges. Can anyone help? 
>>Davescort97</span>|||Answer||| Welcome to AF!
Sounds like a vacuum leak to the brake booster or the check valve mounted inside the brake booster vacuum hose is bad. To check it, disconnect the hose from the engine and brake booster.  Try to blow air through it both ways. Air should only flow towards the engine side of the hose. If it blows both ways or neither way replace the hose and check valve.
The brake booster itself could have a vacuum leak.  But, before you replace the booster, check the vacuum hose for leakage. If there are no leaks in the vacuum hose, the diaphragm of the brake booster is faulty. Put on a new power brake booster. 
>>fords4me|||Followup-question||| Thanks Dave. I ended up replacing the booster and the hiss under the dash when i hit the brakes is gone. Im still having a idle issue though. Any ideas? 
>>Davescort97</span>|||Followup-question||| There may be a vacuum leak somewhere else. 
>>fords4me|||Followup-question||| Turns out it wasnt another vacuum leak. Just to reiterate idle was surging. It would rev then drop, rev and drop. Sometimes it would stall, other times it would even out and stay steady, depending on how long I stayed still. I noticed too while I was driving, it would feel like it was missing almost. Anyway I replaced the fuel pressure regulator today and my problem is solved.
I believe the vacuum was sucking raw fuel into the intake and flooding the engine or at least upsetting the air/fuel mixture. I got this below off a website about a test of and symptoms of a bad regulator.
Fuel Pressure Regulator Test
This test checks the operation of the fuel pressure regulator to make sure it changes line pressure in response to changes in engine vacuum. This is necessary to maintain the proper operating pressure behind the injectors and to compensate for changes in engine load. 
With the engine running, disconnect the vacuum hose from the pressure regulator. As a rule, fuel system pressure should increase 8 to 12 psi with the line disconnected. No change would indicate a faulty pressure regulator, or a leaky or plugged vacuum line.
If the diaphragm inside the regulator is leaking, engine vacuum will suck raw fuel into the intake manifold through the vacuum hose (look for fuel inside the hose).

>>jakegday|||Followup-question||| alright, i went to autozone to buy the kit.  i took the carburetor apart,  rebuilt it using all the new parts that came in the kit, followed the instructions as much as i could (they were quite poor)  and now it actually runs worse.  i had to raise the idle to help it a little. It now dies while driving, like when i let off the gas to go to make a turn or something.  And it still does not start right away either. 
>>>Title||| Get Better Gas Mileage On your Ford!
>>Franco2112|||Original question||| Wow! 
I have a 2001 Expedition EB and owned it since it was new. When it was new it got about 17 mpg on the hwy and 15 in the city. Not bad, gas was about $1 -$1.25 per gallon back then. As it has gotten older it was getting about one mile less give or take. It now has 127,500 on the meter and is still in great shape for I take real good care of it. As of late my fuel consumption has gotten real bad.
I took a look at my maintenance records and found that I had done all I could to get better gas mileage except my PCV. I did not have a time for the change in my records but I new it was changed with in about a two year span. A PCV life span it about 25,000 miles and I put that many miles on the truck in two years.
So I locate the PCV from OReilley's auto parts for $1.83 out the door. Replace the part and filled up at Sam's set the trip counter to zero. 
Wow! What a difference at the gas pedal. Barely touch it and it goes. Also better start up and warms up quicker. I thought that was nice and wondered if it was going to get any better gas mileage. The fuel needle had not moved after about 21 miles shopping around town.  I went back to Sam's and was barely able to pumped in, get this, 1.031 gallons!  That's right! I got 20.36 on one gallon. I will be changing out this low cost part when I change out my air filter. I do this every 10,000 miles. I encourage you to do the same for your vehicle. Your pocket book will love it! 
Amazing!!!!! 
>>Blue)(Fusion|||Followup-question||| Sounds like you have an underlying issue causing excessive oil to get caught in your PCV valve and clog it up.  How does your oil look and how often you you change it?  What kind do you use?
A just changed mine for the first time after 80,000 miles last year.  The old one was still just as functional and clean on the inside as the new one.  And I don't replace my air filter until it's visually dirty.  So far, 20,000 miles on both and both are clean as a whistle.  Don't waste your money if not necessary. 
>>Franco2112|||Followup-question||| I change my oil every 3k. Motorcraft 5w 20 and looks great! The old PVC was not clogged up. It still had some movement and  a little oily. PVC's should move freely. As stated above you should change out your PCV every 25,000 miles. Mine was due. As for my air cleaner it gets dusty out here so every 10,000 miles is not wasted money for me. The mileage and performance shows what a new PCV does.

>>Blue)(Fusion|||Original question||| All the money that went into R&amp;D was made up years and years ago in these cars.  It's practically easy money for Ford to build these cars, especially with the fleet market still loving them.  Ashamed they're ditching one of the few remaining body-on-frame RWD cars on the road.  And the Hemi may have more power, but it's not hard to get a few more ponies out of the 4.6L Modulars if you want to.  I have mine competing with Mustangs (who also have the 4.6L Modular).
And, most police equipment is built specifically to fit in the Crown Vic as are the garages at many departments.  They are probably the cheapest vehicle to maintain in fleet operations. 
>>way2old</span>|||Followup-question||| Chevrolet is bringing back a RWD model,only to be sold to law enforcement.  It will be on a frame from Overseas called the Holden, I think,   Going to watch them perform next September when the new models come out.  I haven't heard what engine is to be in them yet.  I think Ford is going to the Taurus platform with a new vehicle called the Police Interceptor.  Have to wait on that also.  Going to be interesting next year at the tests. 
>>wafrederick|||Followup-question||| I have heard of the 4.6s not holding up in car chases,they blow up.I do know some that works for a township doing maintnence and had one with a blown up 4.6.Plus they are guttless,I was talking to a Constable cop whom is now retired.He was talking to a cop with a Crown Vic,did not get involved car chases due to the power of the Crown Vic.There was a Dodge Charger police car on Horsepower TV improving the horsepower of it,the cop whom drives this one said it more power than the Crown Vic with more get up and handles a lot better. 
>>way2old</span>|||Followup-question||| We have been using the 4.6 since 1992.  We have lost 3 engines.  All 3 were due to drivers going through high water.  We have not lost one to engine related problems. We buy about 100 CV's a year.  So that will give you an estimate as to the percentage.  Our department runs over 2 million miles a year.  So figure the percentage as to how bad the 4.6 is. We purchased 9 Chargers and blew 3 of them in the first month.  So fogure that percentage.   I was skeptical when ewe first got them, but now I believe in them.  The Crown Vic is not made to chase, that is why they make Motorola.  A little money and a few hours and I can make a 4 cylinder Kia out run the Charger also.  Speed is not everything.  I was in Michigan in September for the Police Vehicle Evaluatiopn put on by Michigan State Police and they still have well over 95 % Crown Vic.   We also have some Chargers.  But our officers prefer the Crown because you can see out of them.  We will see what happens next year.

I'm an avid fan of the Panther platform thanks to it's rigidity, visibility, and performance.  It's not meant to be a race car so I can deal with the pick-up-and-go issues.  Although that's easily solved with new rear-end gears anyway.  And I can definitely attest to the visibility in the Vics.  I test drove a Charger and felt like I was in an old time gangster movie with the narrow windows.
And I've never heard of a 4.6 &quot;blowing up.&quot;  Only thing I've ever seen close to that was a Crown Vic running a super charger with too much boost on the NPI stock internals which snapped a rod and punched a hole in the block.

>>>Title||| Decision making
>>eturhan|||Original question||| I am thinking of buying a new car and I would like to get an opinion.
Which one do you think is a better choice for me: Foreign or domestic cars?
Also, what do you think about GM cars? 
>>denisond3|||Followup-question||| I have never bought a new car, so I couldnt advise on specifics. In fact I wouldnt buy a 'new' car even if someone gave me the money - I would still buy a used vehicle.
    But your categorizations are too broad.  There are better or worse foreign AND domestic cars.   Also the criteria for what is a good car is fairly personal.    I dont mind about reliability, since I fix my own cars, but some folks want that above all.  Choosing a car for performance, or for styling, for miles per gallon, for price, would all result in different results.  
There isnt any reason not to buy GM cars these days.
Good Luck making a choice.....
The last thing you want to do is to walk into a dealer's showroom intending to buy -that day-.  The salesmen are experts at convincing you they can give you a deal that can't be beat. 
>>MagicRat</span>|||Followup-question||| This is a very complex subject. 
Generally, in recent years, domestic North American brands give you the best value... that is, not quite the best car, but at a better price than the imports. 
Japanese brands give you the best quality, and often, the best car, but at a price premium. 
European brands sold in America usually give you more prestige, and often, better performance, but cost more to buy, maintain and insure. 
But there are exceptions. 
-Volkwagens are pretty cheap, but do poorly in customer satisfaction surveys. 
-Suzuki cars are cheap, but seem to be noticibly worse than anything else, except for the cheap Korean cars. 
Personally, I like GM cars... and these days you can swing a good deal at a GM dealership. 
Imo, do some research. Check out Consumer Reports, Edmunds, carsurvey.org, etc. 
Also, do some research on how to handle the car dealership's sales techniques. 
The car salesman is not really there to help you, he's there to take as much of your money as possible. Beware of their sales techniques. There are websites on line with tips on how to handle them. They have many sophisticated sales techniques to take your money... but with some knowledge, you can aviod being trapped by them, and get a good deal. 
Imo, the current sleazy new car dealer system is harmful to the auto industry in general, and I am surprised the consumer puts up with it. I have bought new cars in the past, and I even worked at a dealership for a while. But I would never buy new or used cars from any dealership. These days, I always go for a private used sale, simply because I HATE the 'stealerships'. 
>>denisond3|||Followup-question||| 9 out of 10 folks who have bought a new car from a dealership come out thinking they got some special deal better than the average.  What they got was a good feeling from the marketing skills of the salesperson.   In terms of bargains - if there are any- the owners/employees of the dealership see those.  Not the customer who walks in.  
I dont hate dealerships; sometimes they are the only source for obscure parts that wear out after 20 years and 200,000 miles.  Beyond the parts department however, I am glad to be able to avoid them.

>>sloppyirish|||Answer||| Is it a must to put grease on the back of pads. I just had my breaks done by my brother and I smell a burning smell on my front right side. Is this going to happen because they are new. 
>>rhandwor|||Original question||| I use the adhesive to prevent rattle. If you had grease on your fingers and got it on the rotor it will cause smoke.
If one side had a pad about worn out and the other one good. I would suspect a caliper hanging up. Be careful the rotor will get hot enough to burn your hand.
If you didn't clean up mounting hardware this also causes problems. This is more of a problem where they use salt on the highway. 
>>Davescort97</span>|||Answer||| Welcome to AF!
Never heard of putting grease on the pads.  They reach an extreme temperature and it's the grease you smell burning.  It should be taken back apart and cleaned with brake cleaner. If you have a caliper sticking it's OK to lubricate the rails with a high temperature brake grease. If the brakes are making noise it is because the caliper piston is resonating on the back of the brake pads. Like rhandwor says us 3 M brake adhesive on the back of the pads. Do that, or put some aluminum shims between the  piston and the pads. Never put grease or oil on brake components. 
>>sloppyirish|||Followup-question||| Thank you for your responses. So the burning smell will go away? The brakes are not squeeling but I do here a very little ticking sound when we drive. All the pads have been changed.

>>upmm019|||Original question||| I have an 81 F-100 with a V8, I presume it's a 302.
AT with Overdrive.
The Carb that is on the engine has a tag that reads....
E1TE CMA
I believe it's the Ford 2150 model.
Anyways.... the truck is really hard to start.  you have to pump it like a horny dog and then she will start.  only have to crank it a few times but the pumping is a must...
I've noticed there is a fuel leaking from the front right of the carb and I'm wondering if that is the issue, e.g. loosing prime??
I don't know my carbs at all but I believe that would be from the accelrator pump by looking at this diagram
Any suggestions on solving this issue for me would be great.. it's just and Old beater pickup but I'd like for it to start easily....and don't want to drop hundreds of dollars to fix it....
>>Davescort97</span>|||Answer||| Yes.  It is the accelerator pump that's bad.  Just take the info on the tag to the parts place and they can find the right pump for it. You may have to buy a carb kit, but it won't be too expensive. It would probably be a good idea to put a complete carb kit into it, especially if your mileage is suffering. The needle and seat in the float bowl is about the only moving part that will wear out aside from the accel. pump. 
>>upmm019|||Followup-question||| so that explains why when the truck is cold I have to pump the hell out of it.  HOwever, after running it and it's warm I typically do not have to pump it.
Or based upon that do you think it could be something else?
what should be typically changed out for a carb rebuild?  I don't think the kit comes with the float.  I think sometimes they say you should replace the choke thermostat and choke pull off.
Never rebuilt a carb before, is it all that difficult? 
>>Davescort97</span>|||Followup-question||| I don't think it is something else unless the choke needs to be set. In the kit it will tell you how to set the choke.  It'll say put a 1/4 inch drill bit in between the body and the plate and adjust accordingly. The most important part of a carb rebuild is soaking it in carb cleaner and blowing out the passages with compressed air. The accelerator pump gives a shot of gas into the manifold upon acceleration. It is designed to eliminate a flat spot that can occur upon acceleration. If you have to pump it a lot to get it to start, but once it starts it is ok. then the accelerator pump is the culprit. Most of the carb kits contain the gaskets, needle and seat valve, accelerator pump and a measuring device for setting the float. The float isn't included in a kit, but it isn't needed unless it is logged with gas and doesn't &quot;float&quot; anymore. It's easy to rebuild a carb. Basically the carb is divided into 2 parts--the horn and the body. The horn is the top part and the body contains the float bowl. Other than that like I said, the only moving parts are the choke assembly, accelerator pump and needle and seat and a check ball. When I rebuild a carb I replace the parts that can wear out disregarding many of the parts which are static and have nothing to do with the operation of the carb. It's easier than you think to rebuild a carb. Separate the horn from the body. Soak in carb cleaner and rinse with water. Replace the accelerator pump. Replace the needle and seat valve. Other than  that all you have to do is bend the tab on the float so the fuel level in the bowl is at the proper height. Don't be intimidated by all the parts on the blowup in the picture. Most of those parts are never taken off. You can do it. Go for it. 
>>upmm019|||Followup-question||| I got my kit today from Autozone...

But no instructions.....
I'm not sure where to start.. not sure how the float should be set, etc.
Any advice would be great! 
>>denisond3|||Followup-question||| EVerything that has happened to your carb is normal, with the passage of time.  You should be working on the carb on a nice flat tabletop with a good light.  Be sure to turn the carb upside down and every-which-way before you bring it indoors, to get as much gasoline out as you can.  If you smoke - dont do it while working on the carb, there will be small amounts of fuel that dribble out from time to time.  Dont let any tiny springs or parts get away from you.  Thats the reason for a flat clean area to do the work.  Be sure to unscrew things carefully.  That is, dont get the heads of the screws roughed up, if they are phillips head, be sure to have a good screwdriver, and push hard when first loosening a screw.   Try to remember how tight the screws were, overtightening screws can warp the diecast metal the carb body is made of.   Lay out the parts you take off - using the diagram for a guide.  When I dont have instructions for rebuilding a carb, I just set the float exactly the way it was when I took it apart.  You could even leave the float and needle alone this time - but you need to replace the diaphram for the accelerator pump, and its a good idea to replace the various gaskets.  They often wont come apart in one piece, and you would need to clean the old bits off of the mating surfaces.
   It sounds to me like your automatic choke is not closing properly.  This is really common on an older vehicle, &amp; can be from accumulated crud below the choke 'butterfly', or a weakened choke spring.  Its a bimetallic spiral spring that rotates to a different angle when it gets hot, and with age they dont rotate as far as they did when they were new.   I have never replaced  a spiral spring yet though - I just adjust the carb so it runs okay.  Usually this means I have to adjust it for summer temperatures, and re-adjust it in the late fall, for the colder temperatures.  And sometimes I install a manual choke, so I can do the 'choking' myself.
  Pipecleaners are handy for poking into small passages.
  Dont be surprised if the bottom of the float bowl is covered in super-fine particles of rust; just remember the same powdery stuff will be distributed everywhere inside the carb. 
>>rhandwor|||Followup-question||| You will need a diagram ask Auto Zone what happened to it somebody removed it. 
>>MissouriBound|||Answer||| If all else fails,  
>>upmm019|||Followup-question||| well, I pulled the carb before seeing your last post.
I took it all apart and didn't even check the float level of the old float.  I suppose I could reinstall it and then measure it and then put the new float back into it.
I did notice that the Accel Pump diapraghm has barely any movement when compared to the new one.
the bowl had lots of junk in it too but overall not too much varnish.
Lastly... I noticed that there are two tubes that come off the carb that run down to the right side exhause manifold that appear to have rusted away at the manifold side.  
Not sure what I can do with those now but one seems to feed back into the choke assembly.
I didnt get a new thermostatic spring housing but I think I will just to be on the safe side.
I also wrecked the fuel line as the nut was all seized up on it. so I'll just have to cut it and put some tubing on it to the fuel filter.
I was going to buy a soak kit but that was over fifty bucks at my parts place so I just used cans of gumout.  I need to get more today and clean all of the smaller parts and then I can start to reassemble. 
>>upmm019|||Followup-question||| I may need some pointers about how to tune it too.
the two screws at the base I took out but I screwed them in and counted the turns so I can get them back to as close as they were before but I don't know what they actually do.
Also when you say adjust for summer and winter for the choke I'm not sure how that is done either.
All I can say is prior to taking the carb apart.... the truck started hard after it had sat for multiple days... required lots of cranking and pumping.  Holding the pedal down didn't really help.  However, once running, any time thereafter it would start just fine.
I drove it yesterday and gas was just running out of the accelerator pump area. In general for the v8 302 it didn't have much get up and go... I'm thinking that may be different after the carb rebuild.

>>MagicRat</span>|||Original question||| A buddy of mine has a '91 Ford F-150 with a 302 V8 approx. 100k miles 
he emailed me a question that I cannot answer. Here it is:
Hi I have electrical troubles with 150 - no spark, all ignition parts are new, but after rainy day no spark. 
All connectors are clean, looks like wiring damaged. Do you have any ideas where I can find incoming and outcoming voltages on ingnition connectors? 
I had three different ICMs in this car and problem appeared again, the last module was ok, according to Partsource (auto parts retailer) tester. 
My book shows no voltages just connections, doesn't help a lot.
Any ideas or suggestions?
Thank you. 
>>rhandwor|||Answer||| Use a 12 volt test light check for 12 volt to the coil negative. If he has voltage put the test light on the coil negative have somebody crank the engine. If the light doesn't blink he has a bad pickup in the distributor.
  Search THE415  This is the tool needed to replace the pickup. Otherwise buy a rebuilt or junkyard distributor.
Check for a loose ground by computer. Cars were in right kick panel.

>>67ford|||Original question||| my 1967 fairlane has been torn apart for two years finally got back together started her up now water pump is not flowing water. Moroso has a life span of 3200 operating hours this one has under 100 hours of operating time. Does anyone know if it is possible that it is locked up due to setting for two years unused? and if so is it possible to rebuild this thing since it cost $300 dollars? 
>>MagicRat</span>|||Followup-question||| I would say go back to basics. Check the wires to the pump itself. Do you get power to the hot wire? Is the ground wire (or chassis ground) good?
Are you sure the wires are not reversed? (This would make the pump run backwards, preventing flow).
Also, are you sure it's not another problem, such as a stuck thermostat or other coolant obstruction? 
(I even had a mouse nest occur in an upper rad hose, once).
Also, try removing the pump and spin the impeller by hand. Does it feel seized or rough when turned? Possibly the impeller is loose on the shaft or has become corroded. Try applying 12 volts and a ground wire to the harness and see if the shaft spins. 
I think the only way your pump could go bad when just sitting is if the engine coolant or water seeped past the pumps impeller shaft seal and contaminated the bearings or electric motor itself. 
>>67ford|||Answer||| thx for your post turns out it was a closed thermostat and a bad ground connection to the block. just removed thermostat and made a new ground connection and presto i have power. now I can move on to replacing the transmission. Thx for your help.

>>MagicRat</span>|||Answer||| Welcome to the forum, Mr Eastwood. I did not know you had moved from Carmel CA to Scottsdale. 
Just kidding. I love those old Torinos. 
Your choke pull-off may not be working. This is a vacuum-operated device that partially opens the choke blade once the engine fires up. It is designed to allow sufficient airflow at idle and prevent the engine from running too rich. 
typically this device is mounted on the side of the carb and can easily be tested by applying a vacuum source. If its defective, it is easily replaced. 
>>'97ventureowner</span>|||Answer||| I would've figured it was Starsky or Hutch asking the question. 
I agree with the above advice, I had a '73 Torino a few years back that I picked up cheap. One of the reasons I got it for a good price was it had the same issue as the OP. It was the choke pull off and once it was replaced, the vehicle ran fine.

ANY SUGGESTIONS, PLEASE HELP, 
>>toddman67|||Answer||| Sounds like you have a low voltage situation and the starter engaged and is now stuck. 
Remove the (+) battery and see if you can turn the engine over by hand with a suitable ratchet and socket on the crankshaft.
Clean the cables, re-charge the battery and make sure you it is in the start (w/key) posistion. 
>>MagicRat</span>|||Answer||| Most old Fords have a 'fusable link' built into the positive battery cable. Yours may have burned out.
This link is like one giant fuse and will burn out if the electrical draw is too high. It is specifically designed to prevent fire etc in the event of shorts in the starter motor or solenoid. 
Often you can find the link in the positive cable. It looks like a rubber-encased 'bulge' Sometimes it is labelled 'FUSABLE LINK'. You can replace the link (a good idea), bypass it or just get a new positive battery cable. 
You can use jumper cables to temporarily bypass the cable in order to test it. 
>>rhandwor|||Answer||| If you have pulled the starter you should notice a burned fuse able link. You can get a used one at a junk yard color coded. If you make one use two wire sizes smaller wire than the large wire. Example if 14 gauge use 18 gauge wire.
Make sure you roll by hand as suggested. 
>>>Title||| Hydraulic Clutch
>>kubira|||Original question||| I have a 1993pc courier and need some assistance with the Hydraulic Clutch. I have owned it over 2 years, there is still the same clutch slippage (%) as there was when i bought it.
I was gong to have it replaced early on, however its never given me any real trouble, and 2 years later, its still hasn't gotten any worse.
I've not adjusted anything as it is hydraulic(not sure what can be adjusted), but im thinking, does bleeding the clutch assy. 
If u ask me, over the 2 years i've had the car, it would be great to fix this very slight clutch problem, just a little bit more stick is all it needs. I know all the signs probly point to worn something or other, just seems strange that it has never gotten any worse 
>>Davescort97</span>|||Answer||| It probably won't make any difference, but I would bleed the system to make sure. 
>>MagicRat</span>|||Answer||| Air in the hydraulic system will make no difference for a slipping clutch. 
Eliminating air in the system results in a firmer pedal and makes clutch disengagement more efficient. However, the degree of clutch engagement will remain the same.

>>cpujunky|||Answer||| You need new struts. 
>>UnexplodedCow|||Answer||| struts may help, but tempos are known to have rear end sag due to their aerodynamic design....especially after high miles (100k+). It'd do you good to replace the springs, and struts, too, just to be safe. 
>>jopower|||Followup-question|||  
      I have a 92 Tempo GL V6 w/125k miles and rear end sag. Part of the problem is 100-200 lbs. extra weight must be carried in the rear... this being a Propane conversion . When trunk and tank are empty she sits 1&quot; lower than stock back there. Has since bought at 75k miles. Struts are not leaking and seem to dampen OK. She corners flat, too. 
Are there taller springs or higher rate springs available? Can I find these springs or a whole strut assembly ready to bolt in from other Ford models near my car's age (92  for instance)? 
Further, the front suspension is somewhat stiff and harsh, yet under hard braking w/full tank she nose dives. On speed bumps and dips she's &quot;pitchy&quot;. Is this common on the V6 Tempo? 
All of this reminds me of a few nose high 60's 
          __________________
>>rhandwor|||Followup-question|||    Sells springs that go over the rear shocks on a 1993 Ford Tempo. These plus new springs front and rear will help. You can also check on air shocks. A spring shop can help you out if you ask what they have available. 
>>UnexplodedCow|||Followup-question||| The V6 model typically came with the hardest springs (at least in the front) of the Tempos. 2.3L models are a bit softer, with smaller diameter anti-sway bars. You'll most likely have the option of OEM or custom, although it is probably possible to fit a spring from a Taurus or Mustang (of the same year) to it. You'd need to look up spring rates, coil diameter, and actually see if the springs fit in your suspension's pockets (probably will). I've seen anti-dive kits for 1st gen Escorts, which directly fit the Tempo, so that might help with the nose-dive on braking. Keep in mind, however, that you're hauling around an all iron engine, and it's the heaviest thing the Escort/Tempo chassis ever carried. The Taurus or Mustang struts won't directly bolt in, as they're very different. '81-'90 Escort struts will, but there's no point since those were for a lighter vehicle than what you have.
  The stock shocks are also mush. I never owned a V6 model, but the 2 2.3's I owned were pretty darn bouncy on bumps (like a typical American car). There's not much in the way of aftermarket support for these cars, although there is a bit of a following for them (known as Sierras) in the UK, so you could look up stores there for parts, but they'll be pretty expensive.

(and continues to be that way today) well i continued to drive the van to the nearest gas station and checked the oil and noticed it was 2+ quarts low added the oil to bring it back to full and checked for any oil leaks...found NO LEAKS at all. so i drove the van as normal for the next 2 days, and now there is a &quot;clicking sound comming from the engine....but only after the van warms up (10-15mins)

>>rhandwor|||Answer||| I would use a manual gage and check the oil pressure.
    This is a picture of one.  If you have good pressure I would try a can of hydraulic lifter cleaner.
You may have a plugged strainer or possibly damaged a bearing if the pressure is actually low.
You can either pull the transmission and move the motor enough to pull the pan. Or you can pull the bolts on the motor and jack up the engine and put 4x4 under the mount. Be very careful and don't break any thing. Use a pump prime tool.
 this is a picture of one.
Make sure the strainer is very clean. You can boil it in an old pan if you want. 
>>denisond3|||Followup-question||| MAssive Guessing Here:    Since the engine revved higher than it might have ever spun before - you might have one or more pushrods that are slightly bent - from hammering open valves that were still coming shut.  If this is the case, running it at moderate speeds might let you go for years.  Pushrods that are bent more than 'a little' can make ticking noises as they rub against the openings they go through - between the valley and the heads.  
   But certainly check the oil pressure first.  The over revving might have also dislodged some crud from the inside of the engine block - that is now partly blocking the strainer.  I would change your oil and filter, then change oil and filter again in perhaps 500 or 1000 miles - to see how much crusty crud comes out.
    I dont know about late model fords, but on the old Mopar V8s, just removing the rocker covers let you see the top of the pushrods, and you could spin them by hand to check whether they ran true or were bent. 
>>Davescort97</span>|||Answer||| When you change your oil and filter you could cut open the old filter with a hacksaw to determine if there are any metal particles (specifically bearing material) that could have come loose. Also, crusty stuff.
When I was a tech at the airiport we did this to all the planes that had oil changes. Whenever we did find such things we were required to tear the engine down and check it for airworthiness.

It was the lock-up toque converter that would sometimes not fully release, due to a problem in the solenoid in the valve body.   Quick cure was to disconnect the plug that made the torque converter lock-up.  But I dont think you can do that on a 2000 Ford, since then the tranny would not work much, if at all. 
>>Blue)(Fusion|||Followup-question||| It also sounds to me like a torque converter lock up.  I'm not even close to a pro, but that would be the first thing I'd suspect.  From what I've read about transmissions, it would be okay to disconnect the torque converter lockup clutch to see if that cures the issue.  you can even run the transmission that way but at reduced fuel economy at speeds of around 40MPH and up (when the lockup clutch would normally engage).

>>denisond3|||Followup-question||| I agree with the first poster.  The value of a 30 year old pickup is going to be overwhelmingly dependent on what condition its in, how much care you have taken of if, whether its is an unusual vehicle for its year; i.e. if it has unusual options or body styling......AND how much time you are willing to wait and keep advertising it.  A totally rust free body for instance, might double or triple the usual price - when you stumble onto the one buyer of hundreds who wants a vintage F150 and is tired of fighting rust-through.  
   You can get an idea by checking out similar vehicles on ebay.com.  Do an advanced search there, looking for completed sales.   And of course, looking on  and put in the search box &quot;+F150 +1978 +craigslist&quot;.  Be sure to have the + signs with no spaces before the term.
    It would cost money to post it on ebay, but that would give you a good idea of the market price, and you arent obligated to sell it, if you include a hefty 'reserve' price.
    Im not a Ford guy, but there are buyers out there who Want an older (simpler) vehicle.  Something with almost no electronics needed for it to run.

If very noticable at idle and not as much at high RPM: Possible cyclinder with low compression.
Another possibility is that one of the coil packs is bad. If you want the coil testing procedure PM me and I will PM it to you.

>>rhandwor|||Answer||| Check the ground for the computer it maybe loose. Also check the fuel pump ground and the fuel pump relay ground. 
>>Scrapper</span>|||Followup-question||| i would maf checked also and have fuel pump see how much pressure you have. whens lastime gas filter been changed and a good tune up? try running some sea foam in the gas it will clean your injectors. but you have alot more sensors. if check engine lite is on you can take it to autozone and they can read it for you and at no cost. 
>>mechhound|||Followup-question||| First offhand guess would be a bad PIP in the distributor. It's kind of a bummer when it's so intermittent like that. If you ever catch it in that state when it won't start, check to see if you are getting spark through the spark plug wires while your grandmother or someone else cranks it. I know the OP said they have spark, this is in response to bflan. 
>>>Title||| Steam from tail pipe Equals?
>>khadma|||Original question||| After replacing the DPFE on the 95 Windstar, I took the van for a test drive.
The codes to the DPFE were gone, but after parking the van I noticed that there was steam coming from the tail pipe. My question is.....any ideas about the damage to the engine? Head gaskets - cracked block.
The temp rose real fast and the engine is idling really rough at this point.
Anyway, thoughts? 
>>rhandwor|||Answer||| I would use a pressure tester pump up the system to around 10psi start the engine if the gage pulses you have a blown head gasket. This is a picture of one. 
If you need an adapter use the search function. Most any independent will do them for you cost about 30 minutes shop time. Most shops are $50 to $100 per hour ask first. A radiator shop can check for combustion gas in the anti freeze.
If you do head gaskets pay a machine shop to do a pressure test on the heads. Use a flash light and lay it flat on top of the block cracks should be visible. Look closely between cylinders.

>>>Title||| Dropping Tranmission
>>chris_mw|||Original question||| I'm pulling the manual transmission out of an '89 Ford Aerostar.  I've never done clutch/trany work before and I was wondering if a nice floor jack and a couple nylon straps will be secure enough to hold the transmission steady as it slides back and lowered.  That's the method recommended by the (insert personal feelings here) haynes repair manual.
The transmission seems somewhat heavy and I was thinking of putting the jack's plate/pan slightly toward the half that connects to the motor (the bigger half; rear wheel drive) and cross the straps in an &quot;X&quot; fashion under the jack's plate/pan and roughly over the center on top of the transmission.
Any advice is appreciated, thanks, chris 
>>MagicRat</span>|||Followup-question||| Welcome to AF. 
Transmissions are heavy (100-200+ lbs with converter), depending on the model. 
Obviously they can injure you if they fall off a jack, so keep your limbs out from underneath it when you pull it loose. 
Place a piece of wood ( I use an approx. 12x18&quot; piece of plywood) on top of the jack to protect the pan, or else you may dent it. 
The most important thing is to place the jack at the balance point of the transmission, usually on the pan, usually a quarter of the way back. Some trial  and error and great care will help here. 
I have never strapped a trans down to the jsck because if the jack is off-balance, the trans will fall over anyways, whether its attached to the jack or not. 
BTW you do have a nice big, wide floor jack right? A tiny floor jack is not up to the job. 
>>chris_mw|||Answer||| Thanks for the advice.
Yes I am using a nice size hydraulic, rolling, floor jack, with a plate about the size of a (large) palm of hand.
The transmission is a 5-speed manual, so it is smaller and lighter than most automatics (but still a little heavy).  There doesn't seem to be a &quot;pan&quot; on the bottom side, I'm guessing that is usually on automatics.  So I'm going to have to balance it on one of the small external ribs on the underside.

The article says that many of the complaints were that the valves were severely cracked or cracked and leaking, and others said that the tires lost inflation and needed to be replaced.

>>Psychopete|||Followup-question||| Old post but,
If it has a dry intake (upper hose goes into the timing cover) it is a 351C or M. If it has a coolant neck into the lower intake, it is a 351W.
The C and M look a lot a like, you can tell by timing cover, 351c is flat where the coolant goes into, and the (351/400)M is raised about an inch or so. There are pretty interchangeable (cam, heads, NOT intakes), because they're from the same engine family. Intakes won't interchange because of deck height, although spacers have been made to adapt 351c intake onto a modified.
351/400M are essentially the same blocks. The later truck blocks are a lot better with the thrust bearing upgrade w/ manual trans (D7TE?). Only way to tell if it's a 351 or 400 is by removing the oil and looking at the casting # on the crankshaft.
351c has sbf motor mounts and bell, where most modifies have bbf mounts and bell. I believe some 400s were small block bells though. The Ms are big bastards.. Performance wise, you can get power out of it, but at a high cost. Personally, I'd rather have a windsor block..

Escort is as tough as anything out there, though not a real &quot;nice&quot; car, a very GOOD car. 
   For a good Taurus, stay in the '94-'99 era. Avoid the 3.8 engine if it has not been updated with the head gasket &quot;campaign&quot;. 3.0 is a BULLETPROOF little engine, and not as under-powered as you might think. We've found the cars with less electronic options tend to be more durable. 
   The Crown Vics are okay, but very large and not very efficient.  A dinasaur by modern standards. Tough as they come.
   Mustangs are pretty good cars, too, though youngsters tend to tear them up thinking they're a &quot;hot rod&quot;. Some are (a hot rod). Most are not.

>>MrPbody</span>|||Followup-question||| I have to agree with Way2old. Crown Vic is tuff stuff.  Most police departments are NOT going to the Charger. The smartest cops don't chase &quot;bad guys&quot; anyway, they let the radio do the work. Cars that can go 200 MPH are no match for 186,000 miles per SECOND! And with most going 200K or more miles, 4.6 is hardly &quot;junk&quot;.
   Some of the unmarked cars around here are Chargers, but they still stick out like a sore thumb.  They &quot;bristle&quot; with antennas and radar gizmos. Perhaps way2old could shed a little light on the rationale in current LE of using unmarked cars for traffic control. Never made sense to me unless &quot;catching&quot; is considered more important than &quot;prevention&quot;. In California, it used to be policy to have a black and white every few miles (CHP).  That prevented speeders, which helped prevent accidents.
   The modern Impala is gaining popularity with the state cops, but most complain about the lack of room for &quot;their stuff&quot; in the trunk.  They LOVE the way they handle (GM has always had an &quot;edge&quot; in that arena). 
   Saying a 3.0 (Taurus) is not a good engine indicates little or no real-world experience with them.  Unless acted upon by an outside force (blown hose, no tuning, lack of oil change, etc.), they ALWAYS go well over 150K miles.  Taurus isn't the best selling car of it's class/era for nothing.

Autozone usually has little spinning racks by the adhesives with nuts and bolts.  If they are the ones i think they are you can use the ones from the old ford broncos.  As far as the clips for the switch you will have to get creative.  Only way to truly fix that is to replace it, otherwise your just going to be rigging it in place.  Hope this helps.  good luck.

I have begun to wounder about why it is that the 3.8 v6 has a nice low rumble (kinda like a mini v8) where as the 4.0 v6 doesn't. It would seem to me that the 4.0 should have the deeper, meater exhuast note, but yet this is not so. (I might be alone in thinking that the 3.8 sounds better than the 4.0)
So I was woundering if anyone else had looked into/wounder about this.
I tried looking up the diffrencence in the motor to see if i could figure it out.
The essex is a 90 v6, the cologne(4.0) is a 60 v6. 
then I looked at the relation ship to bore and stroke in the essex vs the 4.0. The essex is closer to being a squared off motor. 
Then i looked at the cam specs, the 3.8 is slightly more &quot;agressive&quot;
The fireing orders are the same,
the number of valves are the same, 
The essex has more horsepower than the 4.0
I also have been doing comparissons on the same exhuast system (diameter pipes, and mufflers ext) on both engines, and the essex just sounds better accrosed the board (again just my opinion).
Does anyone know which of these is related more to the exhuast note than the other.

>>'97ventureowner</span>|||Followup-question||| Hopefully there should be more cars and parts available where you live. I bought a '73 Torino back in 2000 and had a hell of a time locating parts in my area. Most if not all of these cars have rusted out in areas that use road salt or have &quot;outlived their usefulness&quot; and been sent to the salvageyard in the sky. The car I bought originally spent most of it's life in Florida, but once it hit NY started to rust fast. I ended up selling the car for scrap 2 years ago because the rust got too far ahead of me to make it a worthwhile resto project. Too bad you didn't post your thread then I could've given you the car as it still had a lot of useable parts.
A couple of good sources for used parts is Hemmings Motor News, a monthly publication with ads from private parties and companies that deal in resto parts, ( both salvage yards and actual resto companies.) Also a website,  has parts for Torinos. You enter your vehicle's info and are taken to a results page for the parts you are looking for from salvage yards across the country. You can even refine your results to salvage yards closer to your home. 
Torinos are so rare in my area, during the period I owned mine, I only recall seeing 2 others on the roads in my area during the summer.

In theory   If I were to take off the valve covers and pour a good amount of special noise reduction oil or even thicker oil on the valves, springs, rollers and shocker. Will the noise stop for a good amount of time. Will this work? Will I be wasting my time? Or is my problem something else. 
>>MagicRat</span>|||Answer||| 
Quote:
>>marksatterfield|||Followup-question||| The repair will depend on the noise.
AF Moderator is correct in that rebuilding is the proper course of action.  However, is this a cost effective solution?  In what condition is the rest of your vehicle?
My experience has been that lots of noise is caused by dirty oil, or low oil.  
Here's what I'd do.
1) Buy some &quot;oil cleaner&quot; (turns out it is usually just kerosene) to loosen up everything in your engine.  DON'T RUN THE ENGINE VERY LONG since if there really is worn out equipment in there, the distillates will reduce oil pressure even more.
2) Drain the oil, and expect sludge.
3) Refill oil with Mobil 1 or some other synthetic oil.
4) Pray for miracles.
At one point I had what I thought was a broken lifter, clang was terrible.  Using the steps above, the noise was resolved.  That was 200,000 miles ago, so it was more than likely a stuck valve.
Be sure to report back to the forum what happens with your vehicle!

>>V8X|||Followup-question||| They've been making Cougars since the 60's.  The 60's models all had good style, as well as good V8 power.  Most of 60's Cougars I've seen came stock with a 302 V8.  The 70's still had good power, but were more like the 70's Cadillac's.  They were really big, so they needed the big V8.  80's models never came with a V8, which is sad but they still had some style points.  90's models look good, but never performed as well as I thought they should.  Now the newest model which doesn't have a V8, has good styling.  I think the newest model has good performance, but it's in the middle of the pack as comparing to it's rivals.  Overall I liked the old 60's models best, just my 2 cents.

>>>Title||| Ford 8N tractor
>>taillight|||Original question||| I'm going to start working on a ford 8N tractor and was hoping someone would have some insight into this problem. There is oil in the coolent but not coolent in the oil. Is there a gasket that could leak oil under pressure into the coolent or am I looking for a crack?  Thank You 
>>rhandwor|||Followup-question||| Is this a diesel or a gasoline engine on this tractor. You have both coolant and oil in the head. If you pull the head take to a machine shop for a pressure test. Then check the head gasket closely. I would stop at a machine shop that does tractor motors. They can give you some good information before you start. Use a flashlight and inspect the outside very closely for a gasket leak. Do you have white smoke indicating coolant in the cylinder. Try using a pressure tester on the radiator when running. A pulsating gage will indicate a head gasket problem.
Do some more looking and asking at a machine shop before dismantling. Thats all they work on is engine problems and usually will be a big help. 
>>taillight|||Answer||| It is a gas engine with a flat head so no oil goes to the head. Built in 1948. No white smoke 
>>rhandwor|||Answer||| Did this tractor freeze up over the winter look for a crack between small welch plugs.
I looked at a tractor forum I have used for a John Deere B for Ford 8N they indicated a leaking head gasket.

>>MrPbody</span>|||Answer||| An 8N with oil in the  water is definitely a crack. There's no other way. Oil pressure overrides water pressure. &quot;Drain back&quot; can't generate the pressure needed to override water pressure.  The oil gallery that runs the length of the block may have a crack to a water passage. Sleeving the gallery is a known &quot;fix&quot;. Blocks are getting harder to find, but you WILL find them, the further East you go, the easier they are to find.  We &quot;do&quot; an average of about 3 8Ns and a couple 9Ns a year. 
   &quot;Pressure testing&quot; the block is a way of finding the problem, but it will need to be completely disassembled and cleaned first. Your local machine shop with tractor experience is exactly correct, per MR.

>>>Title||| How do I retard timing with a sealed PCM system?
>>Pader|||Original question||| I have an '03 Mondeo Ghia Auto and it is much more gas hungry than my former Zetec (manual trans). I am considering playing around with hydroxy as a main fuel. I am already building a circuit to fool the O2 sensors as I have installed rare earth magnets on the fuel line which must be doing something as my fuel consumption rocketed even further suggesting that the PCM tried to compensate for more efficiently burnt fuel.
Many people have had varying degrees of success with hydroxy generators including some that have reported running a car completely on the stuff. I would like to experiment with using high percentage use of hydroxy but the trouble is that my car has fixed timing (you cannot even test it) and because of the far greater efficiency of hydroxy as an exclusive fuel it is likely to cause explosive detonation if the spark is generated before TDC. I am looking for a way (preferably electronic) that I can delay the spark until 10 or 12 degrees ATDC. Has anybody any experience of this?

I presume you mean you wish to drop a F150 body on a Bronco frame?
Frankly, the driveline swap is easier than the body swap. 
The Bronco mounts are different because the body is 'one piece', without a seperate box. You could cut off the F150 mounts and weld them on where needed, though. 
You would have to get into the wiring during the swap.......... and muck around with the steering column, cope with hoisting the body without damage, have the hassle of locating a rare rust-free short box pick up bed (expensive!!) etc etc. Even then, I believe the box will still be too long for the Bronco frame 
IMO remove the Bronco cap and modify the body to look like a (very) short box F150.

>>plodder|||Original question||| Hi automotive advisors,
I have a 1996 Ford 350 4x4 Super Diesel Truck that drives great. When the truck slows down to 30 mph's or less, the emergency brake light turns on from the dash and the brakes lose pressure. As the truck speeds up again on the highway or something above 30 the emergency brake light goes off on the dashboard and the brake pressure is restored. What is causing that to occur?
P.S The emergency brake is not in the on position 
>>lamehonda|||Followup-question||| You make it sound like you have air brakes lol.  Have you had the ebrake adjusted?  Maybe the cable is caught or siezed up.  When you say the brakes lose pressure do you mean you have to push the pedal harder?

>>MagicRat</span>|||Followup-question||| This truck has a vacuum brake booster, right?
If yes, the booster is probably leaking vacuum, enough so that the engine-driven vacuum pump only overcomes the leak when the engine is revving faster, as you pick up speed.

>>FTWalker|||Original question||| ~82K miles. Same vehiccle as in the other thread of mine. Ran decent until about 3 weeks ago.
Problem started overnight - literally.
Idles rough, drives rough, and fells like it occasionally wants to cut out under moderate acceleration. Fuel milage was kinda crappy before, and still is (350+ miles per tank when the car was younger, now it's lucky to break 200 since it's came out of retirement)
Plugs are new, wires &amp; cap appear solid, fuel filter's new. Checked the fuel pressure - 38PSI and steady under idle. Vacuum lines appear good and seat firmly.
I don't remember the exact codes, but they translated as:
1)EGR position sensor out of range
2)system lean
3)right O2 sensor lean
Those were the -only- codes, from a quality Snap-On handheld unit.
Pos. sensor replaced w/ new, comp. cleared to re-learn - no change in symptoms or codes.
EGR cleaned thoroughly - as above.
EGR replaced w/ one from a local parts yard, used the new sensor, comp. reset - no change in symptoms, but haven't checked for codes yet.
I'm guessing that I'll have to break down and change the O2 sensors (the symptoms are a good fit), but I'm open to (and hoping for ) something else to try.
Thanks in advance!!

>>>Title||| Code Reader
>>sophiesmom64|||Original question||| I'd like some input about purchasing a code reader.  I'm having trouble with my Escape and I have a feeling it will be turning into a nightmare soon, like in a few hours!
How do code readers work and are they reliable?  I didn't know you could purchase and use them for personal use and have no idea what they are all about.
Thanks! 
>>Davescort97</span>|||Followup-question||| Welcome to AF!  Code readers detect a fault in the OBDll  (Onboard Diagnostics) system of your vehicle. This is called a DTC (Diagnostic trouble code). The DTC is stored in the computer's memory until a scanner is hooked up that can read the code.  The code might not tell you which component has failed or why, but it will tell you which emission control system or sensor circuit the fault is in.
When a basic code reader is plugged into your vehicle's diagnostic connector it will display any diagnoistic trouble codes that are found. The least expensive code readers just give you a number while the better ones give you a definition of the code, too. Any Haynes manual availabale at most parts houses will list the numbers of the trouble codes and tell you which system is at fault. Code readers are very reliable. They don't give false trouble codes.
The most advanced code readers give you real time diagnostic data with a readout of what the code means. These usually cost about $150-$300. A simple code reader that will just give you the DTC number runs about $30-$50, then you will need a manual such as Haynes to tell you what the trouble code is.
If you live near an Auto Zone parts house, they will read the trouble codes on your vehicle that are making the Check Engine Light (CEL) come on. They do this as a free service. Just go in and ask them to pull the codes on your car. So, check them out.  They will be able to tell you what the code is and will be able to tell you which circuit or sensor needs to be fixed to erase the code.   Dave 
>>Tuffdrvr88|||Answer||| You can also by a pocket code reader from your local auto parts store.  You just plug it into the diagnostic link (almost always under the driver side dash, looks like a computer hook up) and turn the key forward.  Press the read button and wait for it to give you a number.  Number will look like p0012.  The book that comes with the reader will have the numbers and descriptions of the problem.  Find the problem and fix it.  If your lucky it may just be the code.  If not...it may be something is wrong that is causing the sensor to read faulty while not being bad.  Its all part of the game.  Good luck.

>>boatmoter|||Original question||| hI,HAVE A 1987 RANGER W/A 1980 LTD AOD &amp; 5.0
from a stop the trans shifts from 1-2-3- before 20 MPH with NO slippage..
at 40 MPH it goes into overdrive but slips going in,it catches,then if acceleratin a little heavy it slips, 
fluid is LITTLE OVERFULL,BUT DOES NOT SMELL BURNED, it also has a B&amp;M shift kit in it..
the kick down cable is gone and a spring holds the kick down lever towards the front of the engine, I don't understand if the kick down cable just puts the trans into passing gear or if its like a throttle pressure type set up..
the truck was this way when I purchased it 5 days ago..
anyone know what the fix is for this AOD ?? 
>>rhandwor|||Answer||| Try to take it back and see if you have any warranty. This could be a big expense if replacing the shift cable doesn't fix it. 
>>MagicRat</span>|||Answer||| All carbureted 5 liter / AOD combos use a throttle position rod, not a 'cable'. 
If the rod is missing, the trans will not work properly. 
IMO you should round up a kick down rod from a wrecking yard and install it. Some bracket fabrication may be required, depending on your carb but it should be pretty straightforward. 
I do wonder if it was left off because the Ranger engine compartment was too tight and did not allow for clearance. You may be able to modify (bend) a stock rod to fit. 
>>>Title||| re-wiring a car
>>me_190|||Original question||| Ok.  I have an 84 ford mustang, and when i got it all the wires under the dash are all messed up and wired poorly.  (to me it looks like whoever built/ worked on the wiring/ electrical just &quot;nigger rigged&quot; it. (excuse my language)  ) .  Anyway its just the basic wires as its just a stripped down drag car, so i was wondering how hard it would be to remove all the wiring and the fuse box and rewire everything myself?
Thanks 
>>Davescort97</span>|||Answer||| It would be fairly difficult.  If all of the wiring and circuits were stock you could get a wiring harness complete from the boneyard and put it in. However, since the previous owner &quot;Cobbed Up&quot; the wiring it would be almost impossible. Many of the connectors etc. would not be there. I used to work in a shop that fixed cars that had had engine fires and had the wiring burned up. It is a time consuming task, but it can be done. We put the harness through the firewall, then connected everything in the engine bay, then connected everytning under the dash. I have always &quot;hated&quot; working on something that someone else had &quot;cobbed up&quot; so I am with you on this. 
>>>Title||| Electric Fan keeps draining Battery Issue
>>IZ1111|||Original question||| I recently replaced my fan with an electric one and installed a Thermoswitch to turn it on when the engine is hot. But I think even though the fan isn't running, it still sucks up the battery's juice. I have the fan wires connected directly to the battery terminals. I know this isn't the right way it should be connected but I don't know the correct way of wiring it so it will only be active when the key is turned.
Any help on where I can wire it so it will only turn on when the key is on? 
>>Davescort97</span>|||Followup-question||| A good way to wire the fan is to tap into your fuse block on a circuit that just comes on when the key is on RUN. The power windows fuse is 30 amps and only powers up when the key is on. I think that would be plenty of juice to run your fan, providing you don't have power windows. This is the circuit I used on my Escort to power some accessories. I used the fuse to hold the wire in place then I put another 30 amp fuse in-line to the lights. Of course the best way to do it would be to put the fan on a relay, hook it up to the battery and wire the relay so it only comes on when the key is on. That way it wouldn't pull too much current and overheat the wiring. You can get a universal relay at the parts house. If your fan draws more than 30 amps this would be the way to go.

You may want to cantact your states Attorney General's office to make sure.
Does seem like a long time for a used vehicle. Do they carry their own credit or was this through a bank. If through a bank, you may be able to converse with their loan department and advise them the auto dealer is playing foul.

>>Talonda_Jones|||Original question||| I have a 1997 Ford Taurus with a 6 disc changer in the truck. Does anyone know how to get the cartridge to eject......it's stuck.  
>>Davescort97</span>|||Answer||| On mine I disrupted the power supply while the changer was in ON mode.  You'll have to disrupt the power someplace other than the ON/OFF switch.  Disconnect the negative battery terminal while the changer is on, then connect it back up or pull the fuse while it is on and replace it.  It should spit it right out.

>>>Title||| Help with 1999 Town Car
>>Bullymom|||Original question||| My Mom's 1999 town car keeps having problems with the lights (panel) and radio starting to go on and off and the car starting to cut out when she is driving it.  Then it completely quits.  The radio will be on but the car won't start back.  After leaving it overnight, it then started with no problems.  About a week before this happened, we had to have her battery replaced.  What could be the problem?  I have been told we need to disconnect the battery because the car got &quot;confused&quot; when the new one was put it.  
Thanks for any help........ 
>>Davescort97</span>|||Answer||| Whenever the battery is disconnected it erases the engine settings in the computer.  Having the battery replaced wouldn't cause any noticable problems. It will &quot;relearn&quot; it's settings within a few miles and you shouldn't expect any drivability problems. The symptoms you describe indicate low voltage in the system. The panel lilghts and the taillights are on the same fuse so if your tail ights  don't work you will know something is wrong by the panel lights being out. Check the tail light fuse. Most likely, you have a bad or loose connection on the battery terminals. Especially, if someone else put it in for you. Sometimes they smear the connections with grease to inhibit corrosion, but sometimes the grease works it's way between the connections and you don't have a good positive or ground. 
>>Bullymom|||Followup-question||| Thanks Dave.  That makes more sense.  They replaced one battery connector because it was pretty corroded.  We had to have the negative one replaced about a month before the battery died because it had corroded through.  When they put the new one in, they put that grease on the terminal that they replaced (positive).  I'll ask about the taillights, but she did say that she got out to open the hood and when she got back in and slammed the door the radio and panel lights all went out.
We'll clean the grease off and reconnect the connectors and also check the fuse and other battery connections.  I'll let you know how it goes.
Thanks,
Terry 
>>>Title||| Need help making a decision.
>>Prempt|||Original question||| I have a 96 Crown Vic PI and just found out that it'll cost $2100 to replace the front frame section due to it being rusted away. The engine has 72,000 miles and I just had the transmission rebuilt two months ago. I would really hate to see that go to waste so I'm thinking I could try taking them out and putting them in another vehicle. 
Could anyone give me a starting point for this so I can educate myself and maybe a place I can search to find a car with no motor/trans so I can use what I have? Thanks in advance. 
>>TeamExploder|||Answer||| If I were you I wouldn't want to let that motor and tranny go to waste either, try looking for another car on craigslist.org and other auto classifieds for a crown vic or the mercury version, more than likely your going to find more cars with motors already than ones without, but may find one with high mileage or something that'd be worth replacing, if you try and go for around the same year then it will be moreless just bolting the motor and tranny in place and just plug wires. 
>>>Title||| Carburetor rebuild instructions/manual?
>>A_Bartle|||Answer||| 
>>lectra|||Answer||| All I really know about rebuilding stuff is that (since you have the exploded view, you can consult that) you put this piece here and put that piece there.  You may have to bore out a throat or something to get everything to seal right.  Beyond that, I'm just playing it by ear.  Try to commence the rebuild in a clean, open work area (important, lots of small parts to lose!) and post any questions or troubles you encounter. 
>>Davescort97</span>|||Original question||| It's really more simple than it looks.  Basically the carb comes apart into 2 pieces.  The horn and the float bowl. After taking it apart soak it for at least 2 hours in carb cleaner. Then clean it with water and an air gun.  The only parts in a carburator that move other than the choke are the idle mixture screws and the seat and needle of the fuel bowl. After putting in the needle and seat you will have to bend a tab on the float to get the fuel to flow at a specific height in the bowl. The instructions will tell what that measurement is. The fuel mixture screw(s) should be turned clockwise until the engine speed slows down and then turned back counter clockwise  1 turn.
There will be gaskets for between the body and the horn. I don't think some will be needed.  The important parts of a carb rebuild are soaking and cleaning it with compressed air. There's a ton of really small passages in there. And like lectra says on disassembly put the parts in order on a clean workplace in order so when you go back to put it together it will be step by step.  Easy does it and you will have no problem with it at all.    Dave 
>>lectra|||Followup-question||| It's amazing how well an old carb can do after just a simple cleaning. I've taken my push-mower from DOA to max. power by just cleaning the carb, and that thing's essentially the same basic system as what's probably found on a 350 small-block.

>>>Title||| A4LD, What works and What doesn't
>>t/a 6.6|||Original question||| I have a freshly rebuilt A4ld transmission and I was wondering what v6 motors can be made to fit it relatively easily. And what it would take to make them fit. 
I am not intrested in trading up to a v8, and have no intrest in turbo 4 bangers. 
>>TeamExploder|||Followup-question||| Don't really know of anyone that has experimented with doing different v6 swaps. You said your not interested in v8's but the explorer 302 5.0 gets approx 18-20 mpg I believe and it has the more torque and HP and if you would change the transfer case to I think it's a 4406 you could have it being a 4X4 instead of AWD which would lead to a little bit more gas mileage since all wheels wouldn't have to spin at the same time. 
>>t/a 6.6|||Answer||| really that is interesting... i haven't heard that before. 
>>TeamExploder|||Answer||| Guess I never did really answer your question lol, sorry, but a 2.3/3.0/4.0 all should bolt up to that transmission.

... of course they have some pretty stiff requirements to make the warranty valied, such as documented flushing of radiator or radiator replacement, but hey! ... if it helps to get a good product, it may be worth it.
.
.
... also be aware that different sales areas have different discounts/rebates going on at different times... I missed by two months an addition $250 rebate on the Winny tranny I just bought. Check with your local dealership for deals ... they vary by yearly quarter. This info prob never will be shown on the website.
There's an engine rebate going on right now in the Southeast ... and perhaps elsewhere. 
>>wiswind</span>|||Followup-question||| I have had a FORD remanufactured transmission in my '96 windstar since about 2000/2001, I have just over 90K on it, and it is still doing very well.
At the time, they had a 2 year 24K mile warranty on them, when the competition had a 1 year 12K mile warranty.
I had it installed at a dealership, $$, but no warranty concerns if something were to go wrong.
It just does not pay to take short cuts with these items.
I had read on several forums of people getting aftermarker, for 1/2 the price.....and were posting again shortly thereafter, very unhappy to be faced with another replacement.....just outside of the warranty period.
I prefer to feel the pain 1 time, I HATE repeat major $$$ repairs.
It hurt.......but as they say.......better to hurt just 1 time.
There is NO savings to replacing the unit again.
FORD has a very detailed TSB that has been updated, about how meticulous one has to be about flushing the cooler(s) when replacing a transmission.
Again, no shortcut here is going to save you anything.
How many posts have we seen about problems with replacement engines or transmissions? 
>>>Title||| Car garaged for 4 years...
>>FTWalker|||Original question||| I've got an '86 LTD wagon (3.8 V6, 76K miles) that's been garaged for 4 years, and it needs to resume duties as a daily driver. No special prep was done to it before storage, but was decently maintained prior to life in the garage. The battery was  ) and was that way for most of the time, but after a bit of distilled water, took a charge and seems to be holding it. The car starts, and sounds quite strong and healthy.
Is there anything I should do beyond the obvious - new tires (age), oil change, maybe new battery - to return this car to service? 
>>Davescort97</span>|||Followup-question||| Nah. Put some gas in her and take off. Some of the seals on the engine and transmission might have gotten hard through no lubrication so after you drive it check underneath for leaks. High Mileage Castrol will soften up the seals and will get them to do what they are supposed to do and the seals on thr tranny should do the same thing with ATF.. 
>>denisond3|||Answer||| *     I would agree a new battery will likely be needed soon.
**   I would bleed the brakes - until ALL of the old fluid was out.  And I wouldnt be surprised if the car needs some brake work fairly soon.  I would expect things like the handbrakes to be stiff - and perhaps not release fully.  If you have the time and energy, spraying penetrating oil on all of the brake bleeder screws each day will make it more likely they can be opened without snapping off. 
>>FTWalker|||Followup-question||| Thanks for the replies.
Had a chance earlier this week to give it a little more extensive check-up...
Oil was about a qt. low, but it's always had a bit of a leak. Coolant was dead on. Smoked a fair bit until it had run for about half an hour - probably until the oil got to where it was needed. Now, not a trace of smoke  
The battery  to be a little weak at holding a charge, but then it hasn't been ran much above an idle, either, with several starts, light checks, etc. Maybe with some actual driving, it'll behave better. &lt;shrug&gt;
The power steering fluid was a smidge low - less than an oz. - topped it off, no problems there.
Tranny shifts fine - all gears - so I'm not worried about it.
The brakes, however...  
>>denisond3|||Followup-question||| You can get rebuild kits for the calipers.  They arent too hard to do.  You push the piston out using the brakes, until they are both about ready to pop loose.  Then you unscrew the brake hose from the calipers, work the pistons out, clean out the muck and polish the bore, put in the new rubber sealing ring and dust cover - and voila! - they should be good for years.   With rear axle wheel cylinders, I usually replace them on an car over 8 years old, or that has been sitting.  At the same time I get a good look at the handbrake cables (usually rusty and stiff.)  With the wheel cylnders replace and the self-adjuster threads cleaned and lubed - you should be okay for some years.  I also do a visual inspect of every inch of brake line, looking for rusty surfaces that are pitted.  Any pits - I replace the line.
    I am willing to pull brakes apart, even when they seem to be working fine; because they are the most important system on a car.     Usually its hard on the back though, all that stooping. 
>>TeamExploder|||Answer||| I'd maybe run some SeaFoam treatment through it. And wouldn't run it to long with that old oil in it. Maybe change anti-freeze. Check fluid level in the rear end. Do the brake bleed, check make sure the rotors haven't collected moisture to produce rust since some garages do have them creases for moisture to get in. Check the air filter/hoses. Since rubber tends to dry out over time and to make sure you don't have any leaks that could cause a problem. Maybe check the gas line filter especially if the car had old gas in and you ran the old gas through since any dirt in there settled to the bottom of the tank. Just my thoughts and suggestions, good luck with your new to you car  
>>FTWalker|||Followup-question||| Interesting development-
Went out yesterday to give the brakes another check before I started getting my hands dirty. When I pumped the pedal a couple dozen times, it actually firmed up! Started &amp; warmed it up, and tested the brakes again... from where the brakes would hold the car in place, I had around 1&quot;+ of pedal left between it and the floor. Plus, the dragging caliper didn't seem nearly so bad. After shutting it down, I pumped the brakes up again - firmed up within 4-5 pumps. 
I went ahead and took off the wheel from the corner that had the questionable caliper. There was a bit of corosion, but nothing really spectacular. The bleed valve turned fairly easily (after hitting it with a little penetrant, just to be safe). The rotor looked pretty decent, with only the type of surface corrosion that you see even on the newer cars that haven't been driven in a couple of weeks. The brake line itself looked smooth and unkinked, and felt fairly flexible.
I'm still going to do a bleed &amp; fill on the brakes to get the old fluid out... It won't take too long, and it'll give me a chance to check the other three corners. Would I have any issues if I switched to a synthetic in a car of this vintage, or should I stick to a standard DOT3?
Also, I've heard a lot of positive stuff on these forums about Seafoam - I'll give that a shot when I change the oil. 
>>TeamExploder|||Followup-question||| There is a couple diff. methods of using the seafoam, one is running it through a full tank of gas and the other is to run it right through the throttle body or carb which a car of your year I'm guessing its a carb, there is kinda one catch though, its said that it can sometimes foul your sparkplugs depending on the condition of the engine. Something else some people have done and I have done myself it isn't the brightest thing but before changing the oil I put a little bit of tranny fluid no more than a quart into the oil because tranny fluid has a type of detergent that cleans internal engine parts. I ran it through my 92 explorer i drove it for 10miles worth of driving I'd say and when I drained my oil it was like pure black. your choice buddy you just have to be careful you don't wanna lock your motor up. And I honestly don't know about the synthetic I would guess its ok, synthetics usually just have additives in them, quite a few people had a debate on weather its a good idea to put synthetic oil in a motor with more than 100k miles on it, and when i just changed my oil in my explorer i put straight 5quart synthetic 5w-30 valvoline in mine it has about 145k miles on it and i have no issues infact it seems to be running more smoothly. Whats the shape of this old this old car? 
>>FTWalker|||Answer||| TeamExploder-
It has a &quot;carb&quot; of sorts... throttle-body fuel injection. Looks like a carb, set up like a carb, just has fuel injectors there instead of floats, etc.
I did a little research on Seafoam after my last post. The engine's really in pretty decent shape (idles smooth, revs sound healthy), so I'll probably just stick to using Seafoam in the fuel and in the crankcase (just prior to an oil change). One can should be enough for both.
I wasn't planning to switch to synthetic motor oil - I was thinking of switching to Valvoline's SynPower brake fluid vs. standard DOT3. My apologies The only motor oil I'll be using is a name-brand high-milage-engine oil.
The overall shape of the car is decent... 79K miles, some surface rust (no holes), and I think the AC (converted from R-12) needs recharged (don't need that  ), but otherwise it's worth putting back into service. 
>>TeamExploder|||Answer||| Yeah...I know the diff between the throttle body and carb...yeah I too would just stick with the seafoam if it's running fine. And I'm there with ya I don't use nothing but the name brand oil either  Them miles are pretty good for that car....I have seen a couple of 80's crown vic's on like craigslist with mileage under 100k people must notta ran them much. But does sound good to put on the road with them kinda miles and if it don't really need mechanical or body work. 
>>FTWalker|||Followup-question||| One week update...
Seems like The Beast is coming back to life  
I've put about 300 miles on it, and it looks like I'm down to some minor irritation issues. The battery  need replaced - it wouldn't hold a charge, plus the pos. terminal post was loose. There was a broken belt in one of the front tires that was causing an apparent alignment and vibration issue... got both fronts replaced (rears looked almost new, and my tire guy said they were fine), and now it tracks true and the vibration is gone. Replaced a low-beam headlight due to it being a bit on the dim side.
All told, I'd figure that I''ve got about $200 invested in getting it back to daily-driver status.
Now for the issues:
The overall ride is a little &quot;floaty&quot; - I'm assuming that new shocks will cure that. Not a big deal, just not to my tastes.
Mild aroma of burning oil (not from the exaust) after a freeway trip of 20 miles - I've been checking the fluids daily, and the engine oil seems to be staying at the full mark. If I had to guess, I'd say some was seeping out the valve cover gaskets. If it doesn't stop in a week or two, I'll try tightening the valve cover bolts and see if it helps.
The wheel bearings probably need greased... the DS front has a small squeak to it. Not even annoying yet, but it's on the list.
AM reception is crap  - guess I need to find one of those filter things.
The biggest deal is that the rear brakes appear to have a small leak somewhere. I need to top off the fluid (for the rear - front's staying OK) every other day or so, but it's less than an oz. each time. It's number one on my to-do list, but it'll have to wait until things settle down a bit after the holidays. At least the brakes work and brake fluid is cheap.
Thanks for the assistance so far, all!

>>>Title||| Tempo sat in parking lot for 6 mos.....
>>FordPimpo|||Original question||| Hello. So I have an early 90's Ford Tempo and early this past summer it died at my job. I decided that I would forget about it seeing as how I could not afford another $500 repair. But recently, I decided to take it to a shop and see what was wrong. They flipped the inertia switch and it started right up. 
Well, that's great, but I need to drive the car about 1000 miles in December and I was simply wondering what if anything I should do or have done to the car since it was sitting for 6 months.  Should I get any of the fluids flushed or anything like that?  THANKS A LOT
(ps, I don't really know a whole hell of a lot about cars) 
>>denisond3|||Followup-question||| You should get the brakes bled, but that should be done annually anyway, and change the motor oil unless its pretty clean.  Also ensure the CV-joint boots are not split.  If so, they should be replaced before your long drive.  Check your transmission fluid.  I would either put a couple of hundred miles on it before your long drive, or I would make sure the ignition system was nice and dry, with no water trapped under caps anywhere.  You would want to check the air in all tires, including the spare, and that the battery connections are not covered in crusty coatings.   Being a Ford I would recommend you put a few drops on oil onto the ignition key and put it into the ign. switch - then leave it in there for ten minutes.  If you do this to all of the door and trunk locks, it cant hurt.  
   Check that all of your lights still work - sockets may be corroded.
   And the wiper blades may have died during the summer.
  We live in south TX in the winters, in N. Va in the summers.  In both locations we have two cars (one for me, another for the wife) that sit for 6 months unused (and outside on gravel), then are used everyday for the next six months.  Other than adding air to the tires, and having wiper blades go streaky - we just start them up and drive them.  We have been doing this for several years, and the cars were far from new when we started doing it. 
>>knelleken|||Answer||| F#@! that last guy.  just check the oil  level, trans fluid, etc.  add fluid as needed. make sure that the brakes work, so you can stop. check tires for exposed steel belting, or pack the trunk full of doughnut spare's. 
>>TENGRAM|||Followup-question||| 6 months isn't that long. i would change the oil, check tranny fluid level (if its an automatic), and add air to the tires as needed. they also sell stuff at the autoparts store to help ge any excess mooisture out of the gasoline. drive it and see how it does. could be that the tires have flat spots, since it sat so long, and may need to be replaced. any other potential problems that you notice you should post up about them here. good luck, enjoy the ride, and ALWAYS check the inertia switch first when the car cranks but doesn't start! 
>>>Title||| Bolt Head Rounded - How do I get it out?
>>looking4help|||Answer|||  
>>rhandwor|||Original question||| I was at Napa getting a drain plug for a transmission. They sell a set of Irwin extractors Sears also sells them. You tap them on and use a ratchet to remove the bolt. They look they have spiral threads on the inside.
I have used a 9/16 socket for a stripped 15mm tapped it on with a hammer and pulled a few bolts. use a 1/2 for a 13mm. I've done this for years on corroded exhaust manifold bolts. Before starting tap the bolt good with a hammer to try and loosen any rust. If they used loctite try heating up the area where the threads are about 350 degrees to allow the loctite to go back to a liquid.
I've done this for years on GM u-joints as they were next to impossible to remove without doing this. It also helps on bell housing bolts with Torx Plus bolts Napa also sells torx plus and sears sells S-K Torx Plus. You will eventually need a set. Also on ebay.

>>chugaboom|||Original question||| 
OK..  
I have  a 92 2.3 with a bad head gasket. 
I have the ability to get a 92 3.0 with a bad trans.
I have searched and searched and everything I have found, (including the haynes repair manual), says that both trucks have the A4LD transmission.. 
I talked with a fella at the parts store who said the trannys may be the same, but they probably have different insides...  But once again all the specs I have found says they are the same...  
The two engines call for trannys with different part numbers in the Advance Auto Parts computer, which is where the aforementioned fella worked.  
This is why my curiosity is peaked.  
Any links to specs or information on these things would be helpful...  
It will be well worth $500 for the truck if my trans will work!!
>>TeamExploder|||Followup-question||| You are right they both take the A4LD or M50D(manual) tranny's the 4.0 motor takes the same also....but how ever since the 2.3 is the small motor it may have a lower gear ratio but it should be alright, cuz if you can take a 302 and bolt it up to a tranny like that then the 3.0 shouldn't rip it apart or anything as long as its good now, these A4LD tranny's are weak. 
>>chugaboom|||Followup-question||| Thank you sir... I appreciate it...  I passed on the deal... I realized it would be more hassle than it was worth anyway.  I am now looking at another Ranger a 94, maybe 95, with the 5 speed.   I had an 89 with the 5 speed 2.3 and I loved it.  The one I am looking to buy is also the 2.3...  And when all is said and done I will fix the 92 so I have two running...   A question, because you seem to be versed in the  Rangers...   This one I am looking at has over 200,000 miles on it...  I really do feel the guy has taken good care of it, and the body is CLEAN!  How much more do you think I will be able to get out of this truck with good maintenance...  he is asking $1200... I will be using it for work, so I do take good care of my vehicles(since they are my money makers)...  The most I have ever seen from one is around 175,000...  Any info will once again be appreciated.. 
>>TeamExploder|||Followup-question||| Yeah, I love the ranger and explorers which except for the body is basically the same build. Umm....I would kinda try to stray from the 95's....reason is because it was first year for new components in interior/wiring all that and sometimes not all things interchange with things from 94 or 96 which can be hassle if you can only afford junk yard parts and can't find the right 95 ranger in the yard. And bout which ever truck that has 200k miles on...I'm not too educated with the 2.3 I've heard of people getting 250k out of them at least with being very well taken care of and with you saying the body is clean then its high likely the truck wasn't beaten or anything and if no leaks are visible and the motor is sound smoot running then I don't know I myself wouldn't buy a ranger or explorer or any vehicle with that kind of mileage at that year for $1200.00. If you were to get a 4.0 OHV motor I could see you getting 300k or more with regular maintnance. But there's other things besides motor and tranny there is the ball joints/u-joints and everything else you've gotta take into consideration with a high mileage vehicle, ya don't want to buy it and then have to replace a bunch of drivetrain parts either because that could be pricey and time consuming.

>>IZ1111|||Answer||| I would like to make my windows darker. Especialy for the hot seasons, plus the nice look. But I hear that many cars get stopped and ticketed because their window are too dark. I want the darkest as possible without going overboard and in the legal limit. Anyone know or as tinted their windows. 
>>denisond3|||Original question||| Those laws are different in each state, and of course there will be slightly different interpretations of the laws in some local jurisdictions.   Here is a link for a website where you can view a .pdf file listing the tint limits for all states:
           This is almost a 2 megabyte file, in case you dont have broadand internet access, and takes a while to download.
     The chart doesnt list all of the related complexities of the laws in all states either; for example, what if you add tint to a window whose glass already has the slight tint as it came from the factory?  Most states would measure the total % of tint - though not all.
     Im sure there is more info if you start from the IWFA home page:
        
    I did a google search for +window +tint +states.   There were plenty of sites, and not all of them had the same information, i.e. they may not be current, or may be wrong.  The TX limits were apparently updated in 2003, and changed somewhat from previous values.  
   Then there is the question of whether you could get a ticket in another state for window tint, even though you were compliant  in the state where your car is registered.  The reciprocity laws for this stuff also vary from state to state. 
>>IZ1111|||Followup-question||| Thanks. I actually found a chart where they had it updated from 02, and it stated that Texas had its year law in 87, saying that only 35%. I'm glad to now see that the new 03 law lowered it to 25%. 
>>lectraplayer|||Followup-question||| One word of warning:  if you're blue-lighted of a night, be sure your dome light is on when the cop gets out of the car, or he may be prone to give you .357 reasons to not have a tint!   Cops HATE not being able to see in the car, and they don't know if you got a gun or not.  The dome light would help him a lot here. 
>>mike avery|||Followup-question||| Another way that i found around this, if you want your car as dark a possible, is to tint the driver and passenger windows the legal limit (35% in CT) and tint the rest excluding windshield 5%.

>>dissolutecws|||Original question||| I own a '93 Ford Ranger 4.0 liter engine standard 5 speed....I've been having problems regarding the clutch, and we've gone through a multitude of things to fix it, and we're having problems. We've already replaced the clutch, pressure plate, throw-out baron [sp], Master Cylinder..And even after replacing all of those with new, WORKING ones..We haven't had any luck on it. We heard that this is a messed up make, and they had some problems when they did this one here, but yeah...We figured a forum would be our best bet if no one else could figure it out. If not, we'll just head to a ford house because that's what we've been advised to do..We just rather fix it ourselves..Anyways, any help would be very appreciated; this truck has been very troublesome for a while now. =)

The body is rust free, everything else runs perfectly.

>>lectraplayer|||Original question||| I was wondering how effective a water injection system would be.  A water injection system, I believe, is similar to nitrous today in that it sprays water into the intake airstream of the engine, and apparently was effective, as I've gotten ahold of a 1959 issue of Popular Mechanics and read an article in it about midget pylon racing.  In which, water injection systems are prohibited.  It must be quite potent to be forbidden in any racing event that does not require stock parts.  Has anyone heard of such a system, and may have any clue to how effective it is and its advantages/caveats?

>>>Title||| Valve adjust on '64 289
>>Icanfixit|||Answer||| I also posted this in the Galaxy section:
   I am working on a 64 Galaxy 289 . The guy had the all the machine done for a basic rebuild. Now the question is. How do you adjust the valves. I do mostlly GM stuff and the Fords that I have worked on before you just tightened down the rocker arms and you were done. 
But on this 64 motor, it has rockers similar to a GM rocker. 
Keep in mind this motor is stock all the way around. nothing fancy. 
>>slash09|||Original question||| I've read before that you can turn the stud nut until the rocker arm touches the valve stem and then tighten 1/2 to 3/4 turn. Or with the engine hot and idling around 1000 rpm's stick a .010 thickness guage between the valve stem and rocker arm and tighten it down until you hear a subtle miss like putt-putt at the tailpipe. Back off slowly 'till it goes away. The .010 is your cushion for safe allowances. This is how my dad did his VW and it worked on his 'stang too. And my bike. 
>>Icanfixit|||Answer||| Gottem adjusted, I just did it like my Chevrolet stuff worked out fine. I turned the rocker nut until the push rod just barely had any play and then turned it another 1/2 turn. Worked great.

>>bobbyd3|||Original question||| So I unfortunately rear-ended someone today, it was a very low speed impact but I hit at just the right spot on a trailer hitch for the airbags to deploy, cracking the windshield in the process.
My car is only worth between 2k and 3.5k depending on where I look.  And Im sure 2 airbags and a windshield cost that if not more, and the insurance company will call it totaled, throw me a check for 2k if im lucky and take the car.
I cant afford another car at the moment, so I had the thought of getting a new windshield out of pocket, stuffing the airbags back in, or cutting them out and not claiming it and just drive it.
Anyone care to share any insight on this subject.  Im not really sure what to do, maybe tomorrow ill have a clear head, but im stressing right now 
>>denisond3|||Followup-question||| Can you get a set of airbags and control module from ebay, and replace them yourself?  I know some states laws and annual safety inspections make this difficult, but once the replacement air bags are installed ... will the inspector care about that?  Here in VA they just insist the airbags look like they are there (I have never seen an inspector poke around the airbag assemblies), and that the check light on the dashboard lights up when the ign. is turned on.    I got a set of air bags &amp; control module for my daughters 97 Neon for $80 a year ago, including shipping - from ebay. 
>>dugan50|||Followup-question||| Each state has different laws regarding airbag replacement.  You will need to check with the Department of Motor Vehicles, Repair shop division, and ask them to look up the law.  In NY (where we are located) once a car is totalled, it is 'branded' and cannot be registered until DMV inspects the car.  This is a totally different inspection than the normal safety inspection done at repair shops and gas stations.  This one is done by DMV cops in a private DMV facility.  In NY, used bags are not allowed &amp; if they remove a bag, check the production number (not the part number) and it does not match the manufacturer codes, they impound the car and charge the owner.  
Check first!!!
If it's allowed, then by all means, used airbags and control units are fine.  If you need to know exactly what to replace for your vehicle, check out our website for those answers and more.

>>old_master</span>|||Followup-question||| 351 2V stands for two venturi carburetor, (2 barrel).
351 4V stands for four venturi carburetor, (4 barrel).
I don't recall the Cleveland engine as being stock in that vehicle, it may have been changed. Are you sure it's a Cleveland and not a Windsor? 351W was very commonly used back then. The 351W and 302 are very similar with many interchangeable parts. Easy way to identify 351C and 351W is the shape and width of the rocker arm cover: On the 351C (&amp; 351M, 400M), the top of the rocker arm cover is angled down away from the center of the engine and is about 6&quot; wide. The 351W (&amp; 302) the top of the rocker arm cover is flat and is about 4&quot; wide. Hope this helps. 
>>>Title||| Overheating Problem &quot;not waterpump&quot; says dealership
>>buzzcauldron|||Original question||| I am having a problem with my 2000 Econoline overheating.  I am posting this here because the econoline forum looks dead.
I am having a problem with the vehicle overheating.  It seems to only happen when the air is on and is running for 30 minutes or more.  Everytime I drive it for 10 minutes or more I smell that overheating smell when I get out.  When It originally happened on the freeway all my coolant leaked out and I had to stop on the shoulder.  The mechanic I took it to then replaced the leaky coolant cap and told me he was worried about the head gasket.
I just bought this vehicle used and have taken it back to the dealer three times.  They can't find the problem.  I don't think they are looking very hard though because it would still be under warranty if they could find it.  They won't even hook it up for a computer diagnostic because &quot;it won't show anything&quot; even after repeated requests.
Any advice with how to deal with my problem or the dealership would be more than appreciated.  I am already weeks behind on a project because of this problem. 
Thanks very much for reading. 
>>rhandwor|||Answer||| Go to a good radiator shop and get it checked to determine if you have a head gasket leaking. They can run a gas analysis for you.
I would also go to another repair shop. 
>>Davescort97</span>|||Followup-question||| Rhandwar is 100% right. Take it to a radiator shop. That's all they do. Are you getting any bubbles in the coolant overflow tank?  Any steam out the tailpipe? I'm thinking along the lines of new thermostat and getting the radiator rodded out. You certainly ought to get it fixed there in Motor City.

>>IZ1111|||Original question||| I want to get the best thing for my engine, but dont really know whats the deal with all the numbers, and why some are colored in a box and others are just plain. What does it mean?
I used the 10W 30 (with the green box) on my car regularly. But I decided to switch to 10W 40 for a better performance, but I was wrong. its even worse. Now I'm thinking of trying 5W 30, to see if I just went the wrong way with the numbers. But I really would like to know whats the big deal about them. 
>>denisond3|||Followup-question||| The difference between using 10w30 and 10w40 should not cause any change in how the engine runs. The best oil to use might be whatever is printed on the top of the oil filler cap on the top of the valve cover. Here is a URL that will tell a lot more about motor oil than you ever imagined there was to know:
I think any oil you buy (other than used drain oil) would be fine for your car - but the later model cars often call for 5w30. If you live in Houston, I dont think it ever gets cold enough that 10W30 wouldnt be equally good. An important point is to change it often enough. You can read about that at 'obistheoilguy'. 
>>IZ1111|||Followup-question||| Ok, thanks. But why would 5w 30 be better for older cars. And how did I get the idea that 10w 40 or the higher the number would be better for older cars. Well I guess I have a lot to read. Thanks again. 
>>denisond3|||Followup-question||| I didnt mean to imply that 5w30 oils would be better for older engines - if they werent designed for it.  But for cars from the 90s, many of them do call for 5w30.  In most cases the owners manuals or service manuals will also say that using 10w30 is fine - if the climate temperatures are not too cold.  For instance, 10w30 is okay for my 92 Escort at 35 degrees and warmer.  It would NOT be good in Minnesota in January though!
    Basically an engine should be able to use the oil it was designed for (and which the maker recommends) from its very first day to it very last day.  If it needs thicker oil, then it also needs something in the motor repaired/replaced or rebuilt.
     The reason lots of folks will begin using thicker oils in an older or high mileage motor is due to high oil consumption or low oil pressure.  I have done it myself.  The thicker oil is not a long term solution, but its a lot easier than putting in new piston rings, new bearings, or replacing a worn oil pump.

>>SBrumbaugh81|||Original question||| A few months ago i took my 1997 ford f150 v-6  to this guys &quot;shop&quot; to get my engine taken out,rebuilt and put back in. I supplied him with all the parts and even gave him a hand when i could. As the bolts were taken off, the alternator, fan, condenser,starter,drive shaft, bumper, and all the parts that needed to be taken off to get the engine out, I made sure that i put them in individual zip lock baggies and labeled them to what they go to. I was very careful to do this. When i had to go to get my radiation treatments out of town for 8 weeks, he ended up &quot;going out of business&quot; and he towed my truck and my car that he was suposed to be fixing to , to a parking lot to an old walmart that had closed down, when i had returned home, i was in disbeleif that he had done this...so i had the vehicles towed home. The truck was unfinished and nothing had been done to it since i had left out of town.    So i finally found someone that was willing to finish the job. But all the bolts that i had carefully labeled were no where to be found !!! i tried getting ahold of this guy several times and he says he cant find them anywhere !!!  So i need someone to help me find out what sizes these bolts are. or help figuring out where i can get the sizes for them. Is there a book that would have a broken down view of everything so i can get the bolt sizes? i really need help on this one. i have looked everywhere i can ...and talked to alot of people, and im afraid im out of answers, someone please help.my email is  
>>12Ounce|||Followup-question||| I would suggest the following:  Go to Home Depot, or the like, and buy an assortment of (long) metric bolts and nuts.  Tag 'em so you will know what they are, &quot;10x1.0mm&quot;, 10x1.5mm&quot; ... etc.  Soon you will be able list all the thread sizes and bolt lengths.  A metric tap/die set can be useful for identifying bolts or bolt holes.
Unfortunately, the standard bolts that you buy at Home Depot will usually have a larger hex head than the automotive ones and often will not work in close areas ... but sometimes NAPA will have socket head bolts that will work in tight quarters.  Or you may have to go to the dealer or junk yard for special cases.

I'm not talkng about running 6000 RPMs down the interstate in second gear, but going downhill at 50mph, your speed increases quickly due to the hill so you change to &quot;regular&quot; drive to keep your speed down without wearing the brakes so much.

>>lectra|||Followup-question||| I don't think the P0420 code was the sensor, but the cat itself.  The PCM figures the cat's going bad if the upstream oxygen sensor and the downstream oxygen sensor match more than they should.  My guess is, based on the new code when you changed one oxygen sensor, is somehow you may have knocked the other sensor loose or something.  Make sure it's plugged in like it should be.  A P0420 code makes it seem like the sensor you pulled was working, but the cat wasn't.  If the sensor wasn't working, I figure the PCM could tell that, as the voltage from it would be pinned on one of the power rails (probably ground), but instead it seemed to be varying a bit (characteristic to a bad CAT).  It should read a somewhat middle range reading, but should be fairly steady.  Clear your code and check the plugs to all your sensors, and see what comes back.
I think P0141 is referring to no activity detected on that sensor, so you may want to check the plugs.

Would someone be so kind as to help a &quot;dumb broad&quot; by telling her where to attach a wire (I thought in the fuse box) so it will only work when I start the car? I figure a ground is a ground (right?)
My gateful thanks in advance.

>>lectra|||Followup-question||| I would figure that you should be able to grab a tap off your ignition switch, or even something that already runs while you want the device to run.  Other than that, you can just use a relay to do the switching.  If it is &quot;ground switched&quot;, like he is saying, your voltmeter should tell you this by registering voltage when the &quot;indicator device&quot; (the device you may grab a tap off of) is off, and then go to ground when the device comes on.  Other than that, it's as simple as bringing your relay control wire by the wire for the existing device and putting a tap in place.  Easy stuff if you can think your way through it.

>>triple7allstar|||Original question||| I'm sure others have posed this question, but what is everyone's opinion on Ford's recent financial woes? I'm not so sure that Ford will go out of business. They seem to be doing things right with their newest vehicles (fusion / edge).
Opinions? 
>>lectra|||Answer||| GM just went through the same thing.  I wouldn't worry too much.  If nothing else, at least the Ford guys are smart enough to scale down the company down, if necessary, they can take it down to a &quot;local-sized&quot; company (but I'm seeing way too many Fords on the road for it to go that far!).  GM's obviously still here, and I expect Ford to stick around awhile longer too.  They are not Enron!opcorn:

>>12Ounce|||Followup-question||| What Ford has done in the &quot;New Economy&quot; ... is to continue to do what worked for years.  But the customer has changed, and Ford can't seem too.
With very little market survey, they continue to decide what's best for us .... then design and build it.  Often wrong, but sometimes it's close.
After this new product is in the marketplace, if there are design/build errors  ... they are first &quot;denied&quot; by Ford ... after that they are &quot;corrected&quot; by lawyers/judges, not engineers.  This formula has worked for decades, and now that customers have more choices and don't have to buy crap .... Ford can't change the way they do business ... they continue to be just too know-it-all smart for their own good!
Just try calling and having an honest two-way conversation with some human being in Ford Corp ... you know, &quot;customer to corporation person&quot;.  It ain't gonna happen.  No people skills.  If you persist in getting beyond the selection menu, they do have a few phone-idiots whose purpose is to shunt you off to some local (independent) Ford dealer.

>>denisond3|||Followup-question||| Im 62, and retired, so Im not much on upgrading peformance or driving off road; prefer improving miles per gallon.   But have you though about adding some gauges to the panel.  Gives you more peace of mind, and shows people you know your truck better than the average.  I insist on having the basic 4 gauges; water temp, oil presure, amps or volts, and fuel level - then I like to add a tachometer, vacuum gauge, oil temperature gauges (for motor oil and tranny oil), maybe a fuel pressure gauge (now days you can hook up an electrical oil pressure gauge to read the fuel pressure in a fuel injected vehicle.)    I also have a GPS unit that I can plug into the car - neat to have the little maps and the actual speed, etc.  If you really go off road - the gps can be handy to know which way is 'back'.  Some of them also tell altitude and compass headings. 
>>>Title||| Rough Idle...
>>A_Bartle|||Original question||| I have a 1976 Ford Maverick and it has a 200 in-line six engine. I purchased it at the beginning of the year, it came from Alabama and it's only got 14,000 miles on it. The car was running very rich and sometimes stalling. I pulled the carburetor (a Carter, model YFA carburetor) and had a mechanic install a carb kit. It ran much better, but was still not quite right. I drove the car to the same mechanic to have him fine tune the carb and check the timing. When I picked the car up, he said that he has worked on many of these I-6 engines and they never run completely &quot;smooth&quot;. After the adjustment, the car seems to run well at highway speeds, but it idles a bit rough, and when I come to a stop sign, it almost seems like it's going to stall. I had a couple of friends (who know more about engines than I do) listen to it, and they said that it sounded like it was starving for gas when idling. One guy said that he thought perhaps one of the ports may be partially blocked, and the mechanic may not have cleaned/soaked the carb good enough when installing the carb kit. 
1.) First, it is a common characteristic that the straight 6 engines idle a bit rough? 
2.) Any suggestions as to what I should be checking for? Could the problem be a sloppy carb kit install?
Thanks for any help you can offer! 
>>supertechnician|||Answer||| I would look more twards the fuel tank itself. It is 30 years old and if it only has 14,000 miles in it, then it has obviously sat up a while. You may have a cloged inlet hose in the tank, due to oxidation build up. This is all based on if it has the original tank on it. later 
>>Davescort97</span>|||Answer||| Check the idle adjustment screw(s) at the base of the carburator. You screw them in until it is lean enough to make the engine slow down, then you screw them back out 3/4 of a turn. 
>>denisond3|||Answer||| I had an ohv six in the 52 Ford F1 that I drove for ten years, and for the entire time it idled poorly.  The hotter the engine was, the worse it idled.  I tried all the usual schemes (except doing a valve job), never did get it to idle smooth.  But on the highway it ran silky smooth, had a broad torque curve - and was happy doing 90 mph.
    I also had a 52 Ford pickup with the flathead V8.  It idled silky smooth, but had weak low end torque, there was vibration above the idle (feeble counterweighting on the crank) and at 60 it felt like you were flogging it.
I would do a compression check on it while warm, see if the values are pretty even.   From being that old, with that little use, there might be a lot of rust on the valve mating surfaces.

>>cow_towngirl|||Original question||| I am trying to get my 1970 Ford Galaxie on the road, and would really appreciate if someone could tell me what engines are interchangeable for a 351 cleveland.
  
>>65comet|||Answer||| The cleveland is the smallest of the big blocks.  So anything larger should easily match the motor mounts already in that car.  A 351 windsor is the largest of the small blocks.  If you want to go the small block/C4 transmission route, be sure you get the motor and trans mounts that go with them.  Then be prepared to possibly do some cutting and fabrication to get the mounts in if that car didn't have the holes for both big block/small block setup from the factory. 
>>bobss396|||Followup-question||| That car will accept a 302, 351C or 351W, 390 and a 429/460. The 351W, 302 will bolt to the C4 I'm sure (hey that ryhmes!). You should find out what transmission that you already have in the car. You shouldn't have to do any cutting, just get the right motor and chassis mounts. A Ford dealer should be able to help with those.

>>>Title||| Replacing Brake Line How To
>>crownvic95|||Original question||| If I want to replace the section of the brake line after the flexible line that comes from the caliper, my question is, are these lines available to be purchased prebent or do I need to purchase one at a specific length and then bend it to fit?
Is there a way I can post a picture to show you specifically?
Thank you. 
>>bobss396|||Followup-question||| I generally make them up from lines sold in 10&quot; increments. They may be sold individually through the dealer. If you want to try it, take out the old one first, take it with you to the parts store. Make sure that the fittings on the new one match what you have. Then bend it to match your old one. Excess length can be looped or make bigger bend radii to take it up.

>>MrEss|||Followup-question||| I would get the engineering numbers that are cast into the cyl' heads and also the intake and compare them with a known true 390 cid 1974 ford truck. Ford made quite a few 2wd 360 cid f250 and f350 pickups. Most of the 4wd 250/350 were 390 cid. Dont axe me why! I believe the only real difference was connecting rod length. Just as ford used a few different parts to create the 428 and 428cj, which were also based on the same block achitecture. Hope that helps you out.

>>Cymrych|||Original question||| Kind of surprising, really. There are quite a few around. I'm sure I can't be the only one who loves these large wagons! Or maybe I'm just surprised since I was looking for a little help with one... 
77 LTD Country Squire, 460 Big Block, 4 bbl carb, about four thousand or so vacuum tubes and fittings (gotta love the late seventies!), and a goofy right taillight.
Taillight has three bulbs, top and middle being the tail/turn/stop bulbs. The top bulb doesn't work at all, the middle works until you step on the brake, then it goes out completely. Both bulbs are new. The sockets show some corrosion and age brittleness, so I figured that I would just replace them with new pigtail sockets and see what happens. But I have a funny feeling this won't solve the problem. I can't quite wrap my brain around the fact that the one working element in the middle bulb will go out exactly when both elements are supposed to be lit (when you step on the brake)!
I'm not real strong when it comes to electrical issues, so any help would be appreciated. Please feel free to dumb-down any advice; I won't take offense! 
>>Cymrych|||Answer||| Turns out I was wrong. Changing out the sockets solved all the problems. Taillights work fine now.

I can remove the little message that shows up by the odometer but not the warning light.  It seems that the only way to have it done is to have a mechanic get at it.
Is there a trick to this? 
>>brokenantimatter|||Answer||| Fix the tire pressure problem or have the sensor serviced. 
>>Johnny Mullet|||Followup-question||| There is a procedure in the owner's manual on how to do it. 2 different setups. One with message center and one without. 
>>BMW320i|||Answer||| Vehicles Without Message Center..............................
To reset the system, press and hold the odometer reset button and wait for the &quot;TIRE PRESSURE SET&quot; light to illuminate. Continue to press the button for three seconds, then release. After three seconds, the low tire pressure warning lamp will flash three times, indicating that the low tire warning system reset procedure is complete.
Vehicles With Message Center.....................................
To reset the system, press and hold the SETUP button and wait for the message center to display &quot;RESET FOR SYSTEM CHECK&quot;. Then press the RESET button and wait for the message center to display &quot;HOLD RESET TO RELEARN&quot;. Press and hold the RESET button for three seconds. The message &quot;HOLD RESET TO RELEARN&quot; and the low tire warning lamp will flash three times, indicating the reset procedure is complete.__________________
PS Make sure the tire pressure is correct before resetting the light 
>>brinkz|||Followup-question||| I have the same issue sort of, just bought it 04 freestar sport, no info center, but on the odometer display it keeps saying &quot;tire reset&quot; tried what the maual says and no luck, even took it back to the dealer with no luck.  There is however no actual low pressure warning light on the dash. 
>>CobraOwner|||Answer||| There aren't any &quot;Pressure Sensors&quot; on the vehicle(04Freestar). Tire pressure is monitored using the ABS sensors. When a tire is turning at a faster rate of speed than the others for a period of time due to low pressure, the warning indicator tells you that a tire is low.
 If you have replaced any tires lately and have mismatched diameters (even a small variation) this could cause the warning indicator to come on.  Uneven tire wear could create the same condition.  You may want to measure your tread depth and/or tire circumference.
 I hope this info is useful!

On 99 windstar,when I start my , engine both radiator fans kick on low, then the high speed relay clicks and they both come on high speed. Fuses are all fine, relays have been swapped to confirm they are working. (including the two by the firewall), my temp gauge on the console works fine, goes up gradually and stays around middle. 
This occurs on a cold start (by cold I mean 0-20 / -15 to 0 up here in alberta right now) so no reason for the fans to come on right away. 
Im thinking the pcm is malfunctioning somehow and telling the fans to turn on even though it knows its cold.
Id love some help on this, since I'm going to have to pull the fan relays to turn the damn things off till i can figure it out. (a no-no I know ) 
>>Teedy36|||Followup-question||| Hi, Randolph, 
I am hoping you can give me some information on a 200 Ford Windstar Van (Wheel Bearing Hub Assembly). Everyone at the Repair Shop says that the installation is easy, but no one one said anything about the third bolt at the top.  it is damn impossible to get to.  Would you happen to know what tool if any can remove this. I have a pully to help in pulling it off. But trying to remove that third bolt ids the reason why my wheel bearing hub assembly has not bee replaced. 
>>randolf|||Answer||| Not sure, I haven't done any steering components on this van, haynes says to remove it and bring it to a shop because of the specialized nature of the assembly. I'm not much on going to a mechanic unless absolutely necessary, sounds like you may have one of those situations. 
>>KimMG|||Followup-question||| Teedy36-
You should start your own thread.  It will give you a wider audience and be less confusing.  Threads are best when they are about one problem/vehicle.
randolf- 
Do you have a meter and a wiring diagram?  Have you checked the engine coolant sensors?  Your vehicle may also have a diode in the circuit, if so, have you checked it?
There is also a Windstar sub catagory at the bottom of the Ford section.  Posting there may help keep your topic from getting lost in the generic catagory. 
>>randolf|||Followup-question||| Yeah, called the coolant temp sending unit on this van, all seems to be fine there, not really sure how I can check it other than checking resistance.
Which circuit are you thinking to check? As far as I understand, the whole system consists of the the temp sending unit, to the pcm, to the fan relays, to the fans.
I'm starting to think maybe someting to do with the a/c, kind of tough to explain why. When i have a/c on the a/c clutch does not kick on, unless I disconnect the a/c pressure switch. 
Seems like a shot in the dark after another shot in the dark though.

>>>Title||| Will load Range C 6-ply tires handle 9,000 lbs.?
>>SPL Tech|||Original question||| I am looking at a Excursion with the V-10 that has the Toyo Wild Country load range C 6- ply tires on it. In the sidewall it says they are rated for 2,480 lbs. each. Well the vehicle weighs 7,500 lbs. stock with a full tank of fuel and me in it. In addition I am adding 1,500 lbs. so that will put me right up to about 5% below the limit of the tires. So I am wondering how close they rate their tires to the failure point. If the rear tires are right at their limit is this ok? Or is it like their limit is their failure point.? 
The tires are brand new and I don’t really want to pay another $700 for tires on top of the already $16,200 I will own on the vehicle.
This question is not in reference to a Jeep. It’s just a general question. I just posted it here because many people have been helpful on this forum so I figure I will get an answer. 
>>midgetracing28|||Answer||| i wouldnt worry about it to much i have load range c tires on my truck and I mainly use it to pull a 2000lbs car trailer with a 3500lbs car and prolly about a 1000lbs of spare parts tires and jack and tools in the bed. The only problem i got is because ym front springs are getting weak from my push bumper its starting to wear the inside of the tires a lil faster. O and by the way my truck is a 91 ford f250 ext cab long bed 4x4 with the 460 auto. the only thing special is it has stiffer rear springs to pull the trailer.

>>>Title||| The newest used car scam at Mac Haik Ford
>>NeverMacHaikFord|||Original question||| If you like wasting time, they will help you at Mac Haik Ford in Houston Tx.  
Hopefully an entertaining read, and a lesson to others as well: 
I stopped by on a Friday night, because I saw one of their vehicles for sale on the internet. I know it was for sale for 25,998. Trained not to give away anything, chit-chatted with the sales guy, how about this car .. yes let's make a test drive. 
Test drive was fine, into his office. He is off to the manager, comes back: &quot;Looks like it was a little more expensive than I said at first&quot; (he said it would be around 26K before we made the test drive) : $27700 (about $30K drive out). 
I told him about the internet. We looked up the vehicle on his pc on their website (still at 25988). Eggs on his face, he did not know what happened, back to his manager. (For those initiated, this is part of the older games: wear you out. My advice - bring a computer game and play it while they are away, you will be amazed how much faster they are back in the office). 
Anyway, we do the back and forth for a while, and I leave because we could not get close enough on price. So far nothing new. 
Next day - I get &quot;the call&quot;. Other manager came in, if I still want it, I can get it for the price I wanted it for yesterday.  So I pack up the family, let's go for a testdrive. 
We arrive, and the game begins. Looking for the key ... where is it ... walk outside, take it from another salesmen. &quot;You are here first, his customer is also coming in for a test drive&quot;. We get the key and drive off. 
We all like it, come back, tell him to get the contract so we can get on our way. 
Key disappears again, so does the car - with the other customer (we really never saw them, so I don't know whether they were there). It will be just five minutes, please wait in the office. I start the get the feeling that I know what is going on - they want to start a bidding war. This is not what I signed up for, so I told them: &quot;Honour the price you said, or I will walk&quot; . Apologies, apologies, but the other customer wants to pay more.  So we leave. 
You might have guessed, but there was another call this morning. Larry (the sales guy) &quot;I got upset with management, went over their head, and they will still sell you the car for the price you wanted&quot;. I said I would think about it (please ...) and looked on the website of the dealer. I was no longer surprised to see the car was still for sale. 
It turned out Larry is the internet fleet manager. I would think he would have been very aware of the internet price before. 
I can't blame people for trying to make a living, or a profit. But have we really come to this? I learned we haven't all the time, and found other dealers who operate with way more integrity. 
My 2cts - stay away from Mac Haik Ford. That's what I will tell my friends. 
>>BULLITTR6|||Followup-question||| So you didn't get that &quot;great Mak Haik feeling&quot;, huh? 
>>KimMG|||Followup-question||| Let corporate know about your experience.  In most states what they did is illegal.  With the third call, and if I still wanted the car, I would have made them bring the car to me with a contract for a lower price due to the fact that after two visits, their place of business doesn't seem to be the place to do business. 
>>NeverMacHaikFord|||Followup-question||| Thanks for replying - Indeed I did not get the great feeling from this.  I also feel it is more helpful to post in communities like this about the experience, then it is to tell corporate about how their sales force is screwing up. 
>>>Title||| F150 Problem it's a puzzle
>>myMHz|||Original question||| Ok so I bought this 84 Ford F150 (351ci) and there is smoke that comes out of the vents. Now the air conditioner (and heater) doesn't work...well at least the fan anyway. There is no smell so I don't think it's wires burning. I have no idea what it is. I'm not the best mechanic in the world so I really need some help.
>>KimMG|||Followup-question||| Do you have a repair manual?  autozone.com has some free repair guides available.  Need to make sure the drain for the heater box is clean so any water or condensation can drain and not cause electrical problems.  Look at a wiring diagram and determine what wires control the fan.  Make sure the fuses are good.  Test the wires for power.  If you need to, test the switch. 
>>rhandwor|||Followup-question||| Are you losing any antifreeze. I've had plugged drains before water on the floor but no smoke. I had a leaking heater core before and when the fan was running it would blow something that you could think was smoke. I would also look for a resister overheating for the fan if real smoke with odor. 
>>myMHz|||Answer||| Thanks for the help. I checked it out but I came across a better deal so I'm just gonna rid myself of this demon Ford. Thanks again. 
>>>Title||| 1985 Ford Tempo possible fuel problem
>>chrisbriggs3|||Original question||| I have a 85 tempo GL 5 speed.  I was driving to work the other morning, I let it warm up for about 2 minutes before I left.  I shifted into third gear about 40mph and the car just died.  It did not hesitate, or sputter like it was out of gas, it just died.  To be on the safe side, I put a couple of gallons of gas in and tried to start it up again.  It started up after about 30 seconds of cranking and idled fine but it smelled like it was running a little rich (I figured it was kind of flooded from trying to start it).  I drove it about a mile, and with a full tank of gas, did the same thing it did earlier in the morning.  I restarted it just fine, and it died again right after I shifted it into third.  Then, it wouldn't start again.  I figured it was the fuel pump, but I can hear the pump turn on when I turn the key.  The car cost me $280 so I really don't want to put much money into it, so I was hoping to have some help troubleshooting it.  I was thinking of relays, regulator, filter, etc.  Anyone provide any help, I have the Chilton/Haynes on order but would like to get it fixed ASAP.  Thanks in advance.

>>brokenantimatter|||Followup-question||| I am tired and drawing a blank at the moment.
Go ahead and change the fuel filter if you suspect it, it probably needs to be done anyways.
Are you feeling any misses in the engine firing or transmission gears? 
Is the transmission fighting you or is the clutch feeling spongy?
Is there any grinding in the gears?
Are you shifting early and causing the engine to die out on you?
Do you have a tach? 
RPM @ Neutral:
RPM @ Coast:
RPM @ 1st:
RPM @ 2nd:
RPM @ 3rd:
RPM @ 10mph:
RPM @ 15mph:
RPM @ 25mph:
RPM @ 35mph:
RPM @ 40mph:
And check the following:
Transmission fluid level and quality
Fuel Pressure at the engine
Without doing a lot of thinking I am leaning towards either a bad transmission filter or faulty transmission/clutch. 
>>chrisbriggs3|||Answer||| I checked the fuel filter, there is no problem with it.  I can blow through it very easily.  I turned the car over with the fuel line disconnected and plenty of fuel came out.  The car won't start now.  I was thinking maybe there was no spark.  The plugs, wires, cap look brand new.  What is the best way to check for spark.
By the way, the tranny cycles smoothly and the fluid level is fine.  The car won't even start anymore, so I think I can rule the tranny out.  Let me know if you have any ideas.

>>BMW320i|||Answer||| I guess that guy did not read you had a 5-speed.  You don't have tranny fluid you have gear oil.  Also you have no tranny filter.  Your transmission is not causing this.  First it is a 1985 it has no eletronics on it to signal the engine to die.  The other gears run fine then it did not stop the engine.  Besides if it did you would know there would be alot of gear grinding and other such noises.  Can you shift into 3rd at other speeds.  How high is the idle at 40  low med or high.  Use your opinion.  Your fuel filter would cause the car to act like it was running out of gas, that is not it either.  Can you give more details.  Miles on car, etc.  other symptoms.  cold or hot outside.  Temp of car at time, etc.

Her 74 Maverick is acting up. Its a I6 with a C6
She described the following:
When shifting into reverse it goes into gear but when she adds some throttle it dies. It also does it when at a stop in drive and adds some throttle. The car can acclerate at idle without dying. 
Any ideas?
The fuel pump, filter, plugs, wires and cap are new. 
>>Zingledot|||Followup-question||| I have a 74 Maverik and just happened to notice this thread.
I'm not a mechanic by any means, but I can share my experience with my Maverik because it just started doing this again this past week.
When it's cold outside...the Maverik will not go into reverse until it's running hot.  Not just warm, hot.  I've learned to just back into parking spots so I don't have to wait for it to warm up.  Otherwise it will start, warm up, go into reverse...but the second you press the gas it dies.
I had to bag the timing off a bit this week as it got colder because it was flooding itself.  Stopped it from doing it when put into drive. 
I don't know if this helps at all or if this is the same problem you are experiencing.  I'm hoping to hear a mechanical explanation from someone here as well.

I have run old trucks and farm machinery (most older than 1964) on gasoline with no additive for many years with no problems. Believe me these engines work a lot harder than your Fairlane ever will. If it makes you feel better, by all means use an additive. Happy motoring in your newly purchased Fairlane.

>>rhandwor|||Followup-question||| You may have go to an electric shop and pay a flat rate to get it fixed. It might take a couple of hours it might take a couple of days.
I would talk to this mechanic again take your dad with you. If what you say is correct this is a case of fraud. Since he did the work he should know how to fix it. You might have to pay him something.
If all else fails take him to small claims court. He knows you are short on money and is taking advantage of you.
Some junk yards have a place where they swap transmissions and motors. 
You could check with them they would use all used parts to replace any missing controls and get it running. I wouldn't normally recommend them but in your case getting it running with junk parts might be the way to go. The wiring harness should cover both and they would know what is missing. As mazda built the probe parts should be readible.

>>rhandwor|||Answer||| I have had to replace more coil packs than modules for this problem. Using an ohm meter check your plug wires first. After unbolting your coil use an ohm meter and check the olms. Mark this coil and remove the other unit. If the ohms aren't the same your have found the problem usually one part won't ohm on the bad one. I've found a yard that sells them for $3.00 a piece and $10.00 for the module and coils.

>>PTG1212|||Original question||| My son rececently graduated college and needs a decent used car in $5k - $6k range. Which model Fords tend to be the most reliable (and good gas mileage). I have a 2002 Taurus and I love the car. What about the Focus. It's always gotten high marks for handling, early ones had some issues, has that been fixed? Any suggestions or comments on models or better years, etc would be appreciated. Thanks. 
>>brokenantimatter|||Followup-question||| It really depends on how much you trust your son as a driver and his automotive responibility towards his driving and his car.
I would recommend an escort over a focus. 
>>sandyshores|||Followup-question||| Personally I like the Taurus. It also seems like you have a decent amount of $ to spend, in the range where you could definitley get your hands on something quite nice by way of a used car. A nice short-term lease could be found at swap-a-lease.com though Im not here to promote that site. I found in shopping for a good used car that the consumer reports annual used car guide, which can be found in most public libraries, is a great publication to look at. Best bet=Taurus 
>>Johnny Mullet|||Answer||| Yeah, Taurus is a pretty decent car. Way more reliable than a Focus.

>>>Title||| 1975 Ford Maverick - For Sale
>>Pegboy|||Original question||| I have a 1975 Ford Maverick for sale that I recently purchased from a neighbor. I've only had the car for a short time, but have other projects that demand my attention. I'll be as honest as I can about the car.
The car is an original '75 200 straight-six Mav with a C6 transmission. Everything aside from a few suspension parts that were replaced (bushings, etc.) is original. The car is it's original brown color (how 70's) with tan interior. The car does not run.
The body is straight and solid, and there isn't much rust at all, and the rust that is there is only surface. The are two dents on the roof of the vehicle, and a dent on the hood, which is a little bent, it seems. The trunk lid, doors and quarters seem to be straight and dent free, though. No rust through anywhere.
The interior is in good shape. The seats are there with original upholstry, so far as I can tell, and the back seat isn't ripped. The front bench has a cover over it, but it seems just fine. I haven't looked under it. The dash has cracks. The headliner is in good shape, but has begun to sag. Carpet, steering wheel, gauges, etc. all there and in good condition being what they are.
Good wheels and tires, and the wheels happen to be original, with very nice condition original Ford Motor Company hubcaps. 
Now for the bad news, and why I'm not too concerned with keeping it myself. The engine has a hole in the side of the block, near the back. While the rest of the engine is complete, the car no longer runs, and I don't have a six cylinder to replace it with.
The car would be good for a parts car, or, if you have a straight six block, good to restore. It seems a shame that it might have to be used for parts, but be what it may, it must go. I have 7 pictures of the car; just e-mail me if you want them. Like I said, aside from the block, it is a really good car, and in great shape for being a basically unmolested 1975 car, and would make a good project.
I'm asking $300 for the whole deal. Car has a clean title, and everything goes. E-mail or call if interested.

>>93rangerxlt|||Original question||| Ok first off I am new to this forum, but not to forums at all.
I just bought a 1993 Ford Ranger 4.0L Extended cab and I knew when I bought it that it ran because just in Febuary I replaced the clutch in it.
I got it home and the owner told me how he got it running. He would take a set of jumper cables and hook them to a car and then hook the negative to the negative battery and then to the starter relay (which is not good for the starter). So I replaced the ignition switch which did not fix the problem, replaced the starter that he burned up running it the way he was. 
The starter relay is brand new also.
Now I am stumped no power to anything with a good battery and turn the key and nothing happens. The wires to the starter are all good and the wires from the relay are all good. I checked everysingle fuse in the fuse boxes and none are blown so I have no clue and any helped would be appriciated greatly. 
I am sure I have left something out so any questions please ask.

I know that the standard siphon hose you buy at K-mart isn't long enough to get the gas out of a 98 Taurus/Sable.  The fuel pump had gone out, so I couldn't use the pump and schrader valve trick.  After jacking up the back of the car, there is a point where the rubber filler hose comes down to a metal tube connecter that then goes to another rubber hose on into the tank.  I disconnected the hose there and the siphon hose then was able to make it into the tank from that point.

>>reekor|||Followup-question||| I would personally forget about the tank of gas and call it a learning experience, before the seller of this car changes his/her mind, plus it would be a nice gesture since the seller is being nothing but kind to you in regards to this matter.  Seeing that you bought this car AS-IS you don’t have a legal leg to stand on and it does not matter what the seller told you. When you buy a car AS-IS you buy it with any problems that the car may have. If you don’t want any suspires next time before you buy an AS-IS car ask the owner if you can have a licensed mechanic look at the car before you buy it.  The next seller might not take to you wasting his/her time as well as this one.

>>Dr. Pimento|||Original question||| So I'm working on rebuilding a '64 T-Bird - great car, and wonder of wonders, I pick up a vehicle that has zero problems with the body; no cancer, no dents, dings, bends or buckles - all I have to do is sand, prime and paint.
Well, in addition to getting everything ELSE working, that is.  Poor thing's been sitting for quite some time - 68k on the engine, and that's original - not 168, just sixty-eight thousand miles on the old girl.  Who knows how long it's been idle.
Got the engine to crank and  last Thursday, wonder of wonders, but it idles real heavy, and smokes like a bug-truck in mosquito season.  (White)
Tested things out by closing off both fuel valves at the carburetor, and the engine just keeps rumbling along.  Figure that means the carb' is shot, leaking fuel into the engine.  Not unexpected, seeing as how that's original, too.
So now it's time to invest in a 'new' one - or rebuilt, as the case may be.
 should I go for?  They all are going to set me back the same - right at two-fifty of my hard-earned-you-know-what.
It's a big 390 engine, and the carb' needs to be 600cfm - I've got quotes on Edelbrock, Holley, and the Autolite 4100.
Unfortunately, I've got Pony Carburetor (dot-com) saying that the Autolite 4100 is the &quot;best carburetor ever made&quot;.  At the same time, a friend tells me that he  by Edelbrock, having grown up with them.  Another two guys I work with are pushing me towards aquiring the Holley.
My personal indications lean me towards getting a rebuilt 4100 from Pony, but I'm the first one to admit I  a carburetor to worry with.
What's your opinion, of my three choices?
Is PonyCarburetor.com a good source for info and/or parts?
Is the Autolite 4100 really the &quot;finest four-barrel carburetor that has yet to be made by anybody&quot;?
Etc, etc.
Thanks for taking the time to read all this!
&gt;-~~-&gt; Dr. Pimento 
>>ModMech|||Followup-question||| Dr. Pimento,
You have a very desirable car, and I would hate to have you remove the factory carb and replace it with something that is non-factory, and lose some function and value.
My suggestion is to seek out a local machine shop or engine rebuilder and ask them who in your area is the best at carb work.  Take the carb there with the ID tag attached (makes it much easier to look up settings and parts), and let them rebuild it to &quot;as new&quot; condition.  It is my guess that this will not only be cheaper, but you will have better function and satisfaction in the final result.
I know where I live, there is ONE guy I would trust implicitly to do this, he is a true genius with carbs. 
>>Dr. Pimento|||Followup-question||| Thanks for the response, ModMech.
You're suggesting to  the current Autolite on their, rather than getting another, rebuilt Autolite of the same make/model, because that way the car remains more &quot;as is&quot;?
Also, your comment about your local 'rebuild'er - is it worth trying to look up guys out-of-state, on good recommendations?  Or would it just be best to deal locally.
Of course, if I can't  
>>ModMech|||Answer||| Glen at &quot;Motor Parts&quot;, works in the shop (macnine shop).  651-451-1813
Yes, carbs are different even though they LOOK the same and are listed to &quot;fit&quot; a particular vehicle.  Even if you get the EXACT same carb (by Autolite model/part #s) it will not be EXACTLY correct for your car.  Most likely, it would be close enough, but it did not sound like you were interested in &quot;close enough&quot;. 
>>brokenantimatter|||Answer||| On restore projects we usually use Jegs or Edlebrock remanufactored they are the closest you will get to stock and the will fit and look perfect. 
>>12Ounce|||Followup-question||| If you have white exhaust smoke ... wouldn't that indicate tranny fluid or coolant being sucked into the intake? 
>>Dr. Pimento|||Followup-question||| As an update (Just got back from vacation):
We replaced the carburetor with a Holly model, for a temporary fix, and I am keeping the original Autolite boxed up for a time when I have the free cash to restore it.
The white smoke seems to have stopped, once we replaced the valve stem seals, and ran engine cleaner thru' with the oil (and then changed out said oil, of course) - as well as replacing the fuel line, tank to input.

>>p4el|||Answer||| Ford Motor Company will introduce two all-new crossover vehicles and an expanded range of safety, handling and entertainment features as part of the 2007 vehicle lineup previewed for the media Wednesday at the recently renovated Dearborn Development Center (DDC).  In a marketplace that will soon have more than 300 vehicle models competing for attention, Ford, Lincoln and Mercury will present an array of new and updated models that answer customer demand for fuel-efficiency, safety and distinctive design. 
“Our strategy begins with the customer, and it will lead to more powerful brands and an even stronger product lineup,” said Cisco Codina, group vice president, Ford Marketing, Sales and Service. “We need new innovations and new insights to win customers and to make people’s lives better.” Anticipation is high for a look at the 2007 Ford Edge and Lincoln MKX (pronounced “Mark X”), a pair of all-new crossovers reaching dealerships this fall. And media praise has been strong after early drives of the 2007 Shelby GT500 and in reaction to announcements that the 2007 Ford Fusion and Mercury Milan will offer all-wheel drive. Billed as the “right products at the right time,” the Edge and Lincoln MKX include side airbags and Safety Canopy™ side air curtains as standard equipment. All-wheel drive, DVD-based navigation and satellite radio systems are expected to be popular options.  The ‘07 lineup is evidence of a much deeper awareness and response to customer demands.
>>>Title||| '89 Tempo/Topaz Fan Control Module Q
>>tylernt|||Original question||| Have an A/C-equipped '89 Tempo/Topaz with an inoperative radiator fan. I jumpered the fan to the battery, it works. I jumpered the relay on the drivers side headlight, it clicks and my multimeter says it has continuity when energized. I also tested the coolant temp sensor near the thermostat and it has continuity when the engine is hot.
According to the Haynes, that leaves the cooling fan controller behind the glove compartment. The book does not describe any testing procedure, is this one of those replace-and-hope-that-was-it kind of parts? The kind of auto repair that I hate?
Any advice is appreciated. Thanks!!
P.S. And why did Ford need such a complicated fan system, anyway? How about a relay to kick in the fan when the A/C was on, the engine was hot, or both? Seems to be a whole easier and cheaper to me! 
>>kahjdh|||Followup-question||| This JUST happened to me. I tested everything that you did and that controller in the glove box is the most expensive. I didnt know how to test it so i just started to replace the cheap stuff. First the sensor than the relay, and it turned out the relay was bad even though it tested good so i would try that before you replace anything else.
Edit, i have a 91 tempo L 
>>tylernt|||Answer||| Hmm, good idea. Thanks! 
>>tylernt|||Followup-question||| As a followup, I finally dug into it some more and realized I wasn't getting +12VDC to the harness where the relay plugs in. Traced it back to a blown fusible link. The fan works now... finally!
I guess next time I'll check one more thing before throwing up my hands.

>>junk yard doggie|||Original question||| Hello guys
I have a question about the automatic seatbelt on the drivers side. Of course the other side works just fine. I currently have the motor unpluged and just lift the belt over me to use it. That really blows so I would like to fix it. Unfortunately. I took everything apart and found the problem, the gear that drives on the flat cable is slipping like there is not enough tention on it, or the plastic gear is worn. The gear really dosen't look all that bad. I cant see any way to re adjust the tention. Does any one know where the adjustment is, or if there is any adjustment. If I hold the parts together the gear will stay meshed in with the flat drive cable and operate the belt. Any help ?

the only numbers i see stamped on it are C4AR-7A040 with a large A after that, blow that there is W-2 and a piece that looked like it was attached with screws that had X30 or K30, its hard to tell which
so my question is can i order the bushing with this information? or do i need to know what car it came out of? or at least a model number for it

i got out of work this morning and my car wouldnt start...the batt' was dead...it wouldnt even make the little ticking noise....i went and looked around for anything on and sure enough it was my break lights.....so i got AAA to come jump me...
the only way i could get them to shut off is if i remove the fuse...well..if i do that then i have no break lights and i cant put it in gear because the gears have that lock so you cant take it out of park unless ur foot is on the break...well...without the fuse, it wont work...
so, i need sumhow to get my break lights to shut off...please help.... 
>>brokenantimatter|||Followup-question||| That ticking sound(usually under the dash) occurs when the battery is low or there is an un-needed pull on the battery. 
You break lights are most likely stuck(duh). Carry it to mechanic if you don't feel comfortable for checking on binded break cables or wires.

>>>Title||| I need your guys input on turbo diesel
>>Natedog3507|||Original question||| I'm looking into buying a early or late 90's turbo diesel truck for work purposes and hoping i could get a little advice on what diesel trucks have proven there reliablity any info/advice would be appreciated greatly 
>>brokenantimatter|||Followup-question||| Dodge:
  The Cummings diesel is generally considered the most reliable of all diesel engines of the mid to late 90s.
The Automatics were some what flawed in the torque converter area up until about 1995 or so and both the Automatics and Manuals both had fuel injector problems but if buying a properly maintained used diesel the fuel injectors should have already been changed.
Ford: 
I personally prefer despite every like major flaw each Ford vehicle has. Also DO NOT buy an automatic Ford built between 1986-2002 period. In 1999(I think?) is when Ford started producing the 7.3L Turbo Diesel which I adore.
I don't consider General Motors a real contender in the Diesel market unless we are discussing massive diesels.
The Dodge will hold up its residual value better and has a bigger following in the aftermarket area.
The Ford will cost a few thousand less and last just as long but Ford is going to be facing some serious problems in the near future and the parts availability for their older cars may become a problem when looking at a Vehicle that will out last petroleum diesel fuel itself.

>>>Title||| 97 Explorer XLT V8 Runs Rough poor power/mileage!
>>l2sail|||Original question||| Hello we have a 97 XLT with a V8, 4WD with the following symptoms:
-Idles rough (extremely)
-Gets poor fuel mileage ( normally 18-20 highway, now 12-15!)
-Can pull spark plug wire from 3 different cylinders (I think its 3,5 and 8) and still runs the same (no drop in engine sound/rpm)
-Pulling the plugs from these cylinders shows they are wet and thus getting fuel.
Whats been done, its been brought to two garages (1 a ford dealer) and the diagnostic test at both said to replace the #8 fuel injector or the injector wiring harness or the PCM. (Gave a PCM selftest fail code)
Garage one: 
Replaced spark plugs and spark plug wires
cleaned the fuel rails (found some rust residue) 
Replaced the #8 injector
Tested the injector cablling
Tested compression (all good and level)
Tested Vacuum, all good
Replaced the ignition packs (both)
Tested fuel pressure (Good)
Garage two (Ford Dealership)
Ran diag and it said to replace the PCM which they did and it didnt correct issue.
They they recommend to replace the injector on #8 or the wiring (same as 1st garage)
I know some of the codes the diag gave and I can add them if helpful, I just dont have them with me now.
So at this point we are at a loss, we dont want to keep soaking money into the vehicle, if I dont get any other suggestions we will try replacing the injector in # 8 again and then the wiring harness but I doubt that will fix it, the number 1 garage is not a dealer but specializes in fords. Also the injector replaced was from Ford directly, not an aftermarket unit.
The 1st garage suggests the problem is a HARD engine problem that the computer doesnt have sensors see/diagnose and with the inputs it is getting is adjusting things it can contol, IE timing, fuel delivery and so on to try and correct the issue. IE possibly internal timing chain issue, sticky valves (not closing quick enough when engine running)
Any and all suggestions will be greatly appreciated.
THank You

- Murrrry 
>>pre98zetec|||Answer||| different states-different emmissions. 
>>TerminalVelocity|||Answer||| and here in Ca you got mass smog laws  
>>Murrrry|||Answer||| 
Quote:
>>AltecZX2|||Answer||| emissions = smog...just theirs are more strict 
>>KimMG|||Answer||| Emmissions (smog) laws not only vary by state, but can also vary by county. 
>>ModMech|||Followup-question||| The answer to your question is basically YES, but.......
The Federal Gov't mandates all the basic vehicle emissions, and recently those of off-road engines (boats, trail bikes, generators, locomotives, construction equipment).  Those are the fundamental regulations that EVERYONE must live by, at the minimum.
Some states like Ca and NY among others, have enacted even more strict laws because they have specific pollution problems due to climate, geography (Denver) or just a huge amount of very concentrated traffic.  Often times, the changes to vehicles for these stricter areas are as simple as reprograming the engine compter, but some require additional emissions equipment on the engine.
There are also different fuel mixtures that are used to allegedly help improve emissions, in reality they make it WORSE.  But, because they use stuff that Farmers produce, no one is willing to say in public that ethanol blended fuels are actually worse for emissions.
Then you have states like Tx, where there are actual emissions compliance inspections.  Many states have inspections, some for emissions only, some for safety items only (brakes, tires, lights), and a few with BOTH.
Fun huh? 
>>Murrrry|||Answer||| good grief, that's a lot of information.  thanks! 
>>doggfather69|||Answer||| Yes here in Pennsylvania (Pittsburgh) we have a yearly State insection (Safety) and a yearly emmisions inspection. Its a real pain in the ass. 
>>wiswind</span>|||Followup-question||| As far as the emissions equipment on the car.  There are additional requirements for California.  
The rest of the country is the same (unless there is someplace else that requires the &quot;California emissions&quot; which I am not aware of).
What differs from area to area is what TESTING is required to make sure that the vehicle is still meeting the emissions.
The EPA mandates that certain areas of the country MUST have yearly inspections (and in some areas, also special &quot;reformulated gasoline&quot;).
Point is, the emission requirements (except California) are the same for all areas, but it is only the testing requirements that change.
Just like.....the brakes are the same for your vehicle in all states, but some states require yearly inspections to make sure that the brakes are working.

>>MagicRat</span>|||Answer||| This is an old and pretty stupid revenge/annoyance trick, but pretty easy to fix. 
Go to a car wash, the kind with the high pressure hand-held sprayer. 
Go for the soapy hot water spray, and spray directly into the air vent, up and down the length of the vent. The water pressure will blow out the fish residue and flush it out down the drains for the vent. 
These vents are designed to keep  heavy rain out of the interior, but allow the rain water to drain towards the pavement, so most likely none will get in the car. 
But it might be handy to have someone inside the car just to keep an eye out for any water. 
>>KimMG|||Followup-question||| If you are able to prove he did it, file charges, get a restraining order, go to the dealer and get an estimate to have the vents taken apart and cleaned, put the amount of the estimate plus car rental on the restraining order.  If the judge rules against you for the costs on the restraining order, then take him to small claims court.  If you win and you know where he works, collecting will be easy, you can have his wages attached.  The only way to punish jerks like this is to go after their wallets.  The restraining order will make it a felony if he ever goes near your daughters or their property again.  If he violates the restraining order, he can go to jail for up to a year without a trial (no bail, because it would be contempt of court).  If hunting or shooting with the boys is one of his pastimes, it won't be if you get the restraining order, he won't be allowed to possess firearms.  At the very least get the restraining order, it is worth it.

>>>Title||| Tempo Brake Line Replacement
>>paulstamser|||Original question||| Are the rear steel brake lines typically one LONG piece from the rear flexible hose connection to somewhere up above the front left wheel?
I ask because I blew a rear brake line (driver side) and tried to find a junction without success. Traced both lines best I could but they are hidden and hard to see and then go upside near the front left wheel.
I guess my best bet is to use the universal lines as I could NEVER route the long original bent line into all those nooks and crannies. Looks like they built the car around the brake lines.
Anyone with brake line replacement experience have any tips?
Thank you! 
>>cougarman|||Followup-question||| The brake line is one piece from the rear flex all the way to the proportioning valve. The best way to replace it, and even the dealers do it this way is buy replacement line by the foot, and buy new fittings. You have to make up the new line and route it as you wish trying to keep in mind to make sure your line is routed away from exhaust and away from being damaged by rocks/hoists etc.Don't worry about removing the old line, thats just too much extra work. A shop would probably charge 3-4 hours labour. Make sure you know how to properly flare the ends of the lines.
Have Fun 
>>MagicRat</span>|||Followup-question||| ^^ good post^^
However, if you do not want to flare your own lines, just measure how long you need and buy one or more pre-flared lines with fittings. 
For example, if I need 6 feet of line, (but a 6 foot pre-flared piece is not available) I can buy a 4 ft section, a 2 ft section and a brass junction fitting instead. 
Doing good brake flares is a bit tricky to learn and requires a tool kit.  If this is your only brake line repair, the pre-flared sections are quicker and cheaper to use.

>>redneck_hooker|||Original question||| Hi, I have a 1992 Ford Exploder. I finally lost the alarm remote for it. How do I uninstall the system so that I can start my truck? It is a Ford Vehicle Security System. I hqave the entire system out, if I reconnect the lock motor &amp; unlock motor wires and the lock switch &amp; unlock switch wires by splicing them will they work? I don't want to cut the wires if it is not going to solve my problem. 
>>redneck_hooker|||Followup-question||| Solved my own problem. My truck is now without a security system but I can start it. If you have this problem, what I did was romove the entire system and splice the red/blue lock starter and red unlock starter wires together. I did not have to do anything with the lock/unlock motor or switch wires. II figures I would post this info in case anyone else has the same problem on a Sunday and cannot wait the 3 days it would take to get a replacement remote... Good luck......

>>>Title||| RARE 87 diesel escort turbo LOOK
>>87dieselescort|||Original question||| so a friend of mine bought an 87 diesel escort in the summer of 05. it is a 1.8L diesel engine with a 5 speed manual. this thing has hardly any ponies and acceloration is horrible. the engine has around 200,000 miles on it and it running strong as hell. 
well heres the story. you know how all diesels have turbos. turbos make a diesel perform soo much better. its a night and day difference in performance. well this 1.8L diesel escort has no turbo. we had a AR10 turbo laying around and figured y not try to put it in this diesel escort. the trubo i think is capable of producing around 5-10 P.S.I of boost before it will destroy its self. 
we took off the intake manifold, exaust manifold, the whole exaust, all of the A/C componets, and we stripped the whole interior. we have racing seats that are just laying around that will be installed in to the front and the rest of the car will stayed stripped to lessen wait.
our plans are to have a fricken rally type car because it would be the funniest thing ever and we have plenty of time on our hands to mess around with it and why not when most of the parts are just laying around.
the turbo will be a tight fit but were hoping we will be able to get it to work. the only thing we have to buy is is a boost controller and then were looking into c if maybe some F350 diesel fuel injectors will fit LMAO. also we have a propane shot sytem in mind. a propane shot for diesel is almost like a NOS shot for a gasoline engine. we have it all planned out and it will shoot a spray out in the intake like a NOS fogger system. we are hoping this will be one funny semi badass car haha.
one prob we did encounter though is when we took the carpet out, we found that the WHOLE front floor was rusted all the way throgh. we will have to weld some sheet metal in place to make it safe.
i am hoping to have tons of pictures of this project up within the next week or soo. be sure to keep looking because this is one project that you will want to see finish because it will for sure make you laugh and you will want to tell all you buddies.
thanks for reading sorry it was soo long, shouldnt ever be this long again!

>>silentdarkness1317|||Original question||| were mainly just lookin for rwd tho. however if we dont get ahold of a decent one we'll consider that one. thanks. 
>>AltecZX2|||Followup-question||| best RWD option would be to take a turbo i4 2.3 From a mustang SVO, or a Turbo coupe.
since its turbo if you work it right it can have a nice low end and it can make nice power.
or you can use a mustang v6..but thats kinda  big...Ford doesn't have any really nice RWD small v6, you could always look into mating a Focus or ZX2 Zetec to a european RWD tranny, that will let you build a small, light motor that can have some nice low end.
A zetec with bolt-ons can make a buggy (probably around 800-1200lbs?) move VERY quickly.

>>MagicRat</span>|||Followup-question||| I presume it has a carbureted engine. 
Before you start the car, remove the air cleaner cover. Start the car and look at the carb as it warms up. 
Make sure the throttle blade is opening. If it isn't, likely the power wire for the electric choke was knocked off or severed when the belt let go. 
>>kruzr11803|||Answer||| it does have the carbed engine i forgot to add that earlier 
>>junkyarddawg|||Followup-question||| If it has a carb then it must have a 351 as all the 302s had a throttle body EFI,if it has a carb it sounds like its the ignition module as when they go bad they will quit when getting hot and it should be mounted on the drivers side fender well.  If it has a 302 with EFI it still can be a ignition module problem but its mounted to the distributor as they will act up when the motor warms up.  Jeff

>>TugHillTina|||Answer||| My mother in law has one and here are my gripes:
1. Sitting in the back is a uncomfortable experience, I'm 5'9 and feel cramped.  I also can't stand not being able to see very far in front of me, the seats are low to the floor and all I see is the seat back of the front seat.  Not good if you get carsick. 
2. Road noise is pronounced big time.
3. She just got hers back from the shop, now mind you this is a 05 model and the brakes were shot down to the medal. Luckily it was under warranty.
4. I do not like the hump on the floor next to the brake pedal. It doesn't let me stretch my leg out to &quot;unlock&quot; my knee. I had a track accident many moons ago and I have to be able to straighten out my left leg from time to time and with that hump there it's a no go. I had to pull the van over and get out to straighten out my leg.
Now these are just my personal experiences, I'm a huge ford lover but the freestar is one of my least favorite vehicles.  Another friend of mine loves hers and has had no issues so it really varies on the individual.

The head gasket is labled right side top, &amp; left side top.

>>>Title||| How to build super-efficient Fords...
>>RichardEParson|||Original question||| Visit this site...  
I sent this to FORD and GM, so they have been told. This proves they want our fuel consumption to stay they way it is! 
How do you build such a car? The fact of the matter is that internal combustion cars are only about 25% thermally efficient. 75% of the heat energy goes into the radiator. That is a terrible waste. How would a car company use this energy more efficiently? 
1)External combustion 
a)Using a modern flash boiler system means that a larger boiler carrying many gallons of water is not needed. 
I. Modern mono-tube boilers need only about 3-5 gallons of water. Only a small percentage of this is actaul steam. They are less likely to explode as they use less volatile fuels. Modern steam generators for automotive use are constructed in such a way that in case of a rupture they have vary little water at the saturation point, preventing an explosion. 
II.The boiler could pick up as much as 1200 degrees of heat coming off the exhaust manifold. That would be more than 800 lbs of pressure. Very useful 
III. The boiler could be wrapped by the exhaust header(s) soaking up the heat and help catalytic converter light-off by being heated up by use of a electric element. 
IV. If a steam engine is used in combination with a diesal the transmission could be deleted or switched to a centrifugal clutch allowing direct drive. Direct drive and lock up clutching allow for better fuel economy and less weight which helps economy also. 
The engine without a transmission could sit low and back for excellent handling. If combined further with an electric motor the gasoline engine could be throttled back to the point that it merely generates heat and the air/fuel ratio is leaned out quite a bit further improving economy. Another idea is to include a small transmission. And have each component able to couple/decouple. That would allow a electric motor to drive the car until the batteries where depleted 
>>>Title||| 460 timing
>>OttoP|||Original question||| I have a 78 RV based on ford truck chassis with a stock 460 engine-4barrel carb.  Anyone know what the initial timing should be set at? 
>>MagicRat</span>|||Followup-question||| My manuals show initial timing (as measured with the vacuum advance disconnected at the distrubutor) of 16 deg. BTDC. 
These is a note that engines made after July 15, 1977 get 10 deg. I suspect this is emissions-related. Using 16 degrees will get you a bit more power and fuel economy so long as it does not ping. 
IMO try 16 degrees and back it off a degree or two if you hear any knock or ping.

Saleen is just for show and their warranty support is crap!!!  I know people who work for Ford dealers doing maintenance and repairs and they all tell me horror stories about Saleen.  Most of them have the customer pay the bill and then let them deal with Saleen since Saleen takes months to pay the dealer that is if they ever pay up.
Shelby is the worst off all of them for over $5500 + sticker you get a CS6 which is nothing more than a body kit and vinyl stripes on a V6.  Or for over $15000+ sticker you get a CS6 stage 2 that is the same as above but with enough power to out run a Mustang GT. How impressive is that?

>>MagicRat</span>|||Followup-question||| Folks, a pushrod Ford 351C, 351M and 460 will not fit in the Camaro chassis. 
They all have front sumps on the oil pan. The Chevy V8 is a rear-sump. 
Therefore, the Camaro front cross member is right where the Ford oil pan has to go. 
Stick a Chevy engine in the thing and save yourself a massive headache. 
>>trinogt|||Followup-question||| It is blasphemy to put an engine in a vehicle from a different make. The Ford 460 is a killer engine, and has incredible bang for the buck... It is also easy to find in rebuildable condition compared to the chev big blocks. 
For the reply about oil pan sumps, Ford trucks and cars had either a front or rear sump. Besides, since when does the need for a modified or custom oil pan and pickup stop someone from using any engine in a project car? It is not a big deal with a basic mig welder.
My advice is to stick with a gm engine in that gm car. Or, if you want Ford reliability and power that bad, get a Ford or Mercury car to build instead. There are many choices of great engines in the Ford stables. Some have been around in some shape or form for many years. Parts may be a little more money (unless it is a 5.0), but you will have a unique engine that not everyone in town will have. That's the beauty of a Ford. Not limited to a 350 or a 454.

In your case, yeah, limited number vehicles are in a specialty class, in which almost anything goes as far as power train. I was talking mainly about the BIG american auto manufactures (the ones that are still around to this day).  I am into restomods when it comes to old 30's cars, but if it's a '34 Ford, why not stick with a modern Ford 5.0? If it's an old chev, stick in a readily available smallblock 350? That's the idea. I know there are a lot of people who simply don't care, but the idea of an 'Updated Ford' or 'updated chev' (restomod), keeping the right brand name parts on each vehicle, is what seems to make the most sense.
Guys like Chip Foose seem to be really driving that idea home, and it really works for him.
Hey, I see on your car list you have a diesel Topaz... I have a '90 Tempo. How is that diesel doing? I heard they get great mileage and last a long time. (I got 220,000 on my 2.3 gas job, and it still doesn't use a drop of oil!)
I would like to find a diesel Tempo/Topaz some day (in good shape). 
>>OverBoardProject|||Followup-question||| Ya the Diesel is one great car.
About 50mpg all around. I go about 600 miles on a tank.
I've got 180,000 miles on it, and it only used oil when the valve cover gasket needed replacing.
It's off the road for the winter.
I know what you mean about cars sticking to their own brand of motor.   I also like to see a Chev rear end under a Chev, and not a 9&quot;
But most of those 30's rods are just cheap copies of the real thing. So most people are trying to run the cheapest motor to build.
Your right, that is starting to change though. People are starting to use Ford motors in their rods, and the aftermarket companies are starting to make parts for our builds.
It'll easily cost me $5000.00 less to finish each of these cars than 5 years ago,since I won't have to get as many items custom built.
I'll hopefully get the (Chevy S10) frame for the 4 door after the holidays, and might start working on it. (If I can colect some of the oney owing to me) 
>>trinogt|||Followup-question||| 50 mpg Topaz? Wow, that is like the VW TDI, alright! Does it have as much power as the TDI? I assume no, if it's not a turbo diesel. Or, is it a turbo? Was it a small tank, like 12 gallon? I think that is what my Tempo has, as I have never put more than 11.5 gallons in it. I heard the TDI gets 1000 miles, so it must be a 20 gallon.
Is it pretty noisy?
I heard that Mitsubishi made the engine, but I also heard recently someone else did... Wish I could find one of these beasts! 
I believe it was the same engine Ford used in the Ranger diesels. my dad had a 1983 diesel, non-turbo.
I think the main reason that the Ford 9 inch is so prevalent in many performance cars, is that it really was one of the toughest differentials around for many years. It also does not use C-clips, which when an axle gets broken, will allow an axle to slide right out, wheel and all, while going down the track. (I've seen it, a chev camaro)
There are now modern versions of the 9 inch built by Moser, and all kinds of new companies, built for high hp and 4 link, reinforced all over for strength.
NHRA would not (and probably still does not)allow chev rears on 1/4 mile tracks in competition (depending on class).
It's a good thing there are so many 9 inch pumpkins at the junkyards. Ford used the 9 inch on all the trucks until 1980's.
Midsize and larger cars all got the 9 inch up to the early 80's as well. Some with disc brakes (Lincoln Versailles)
Mark 
>>OverBoardProject|||Followup-question||| I'll answer the questions as good as I can trinogt;
A 5 speed VW TDI gets 65mpg.  I'm not sure if that's US or Imperian gallons.  There is a big difference between the 2. It goes 1200KM on a tank, so that's about 750 miles.   This would all depend on the driver of course, and is also based on sea level air pressure.
It's actually a pretty quiet Diesel.  It sounds like a gas powered Tpaz with a small hole in the muffler and  tapping valves.  I wish that it had a turbo, and it is a little guttless.
Mitsubishi makes good Diesels but you'll never find them in a Ford, unless it's aftermarket (which mine isn't)  The Diesels found in the Tempo's, Topaz, and even some Escorts was made by Mazda.  You can probably find them in the Mazda 626 and simular cars but I just don't know for sure. Plus they used a simular motor in the Mazda Pickup.
From what I understand they used the same motor in the Ford Ranger, as they did in the Mazda Pickup (2.5L compaied to my 2.0L, plus the pickups were a push rod design and mine is overhead cam)
However I was also told that Ford also used another Diesel in some other Rangers.  Some were turbo charged, but not all.
The way to tell the Mazda motor apart from the other brand is they used 2 oil filters on the Mazda.
I'm in the middle of updating my web site, and I should have more pics added including the motors shortly after the hollidays ( My Topaz is at mom's 8 hours from where I'm living now) 
>>trinogt|||Followup-question||| I've actually driven an A4 Jetta TDI. It was a new 2004 model, before the change. Very good power in this car! No downshift needed with that kind of torque. Very quiet on the road, with no diesel fumes or smoke. The direct injection diesel technology has come a long way to make diesels clean and whisper quiet.
You must be talking imperial gallons when you say 65 mpg. I am in the US, so 50 is the norm here for TDI's, although the new A5 TDI's aren't reporting as good on fuel, for some reason. (heavier car???)
I belong to a VW forum, and someone there gets 1000 miles to a tank. (1600 kms) When I lived in Canada, I remember a tv commercial that said you could drive from Lethbridge, Alberta, to Vancouver, BC on a tank in a TDI. Are you in Canada?
I remember knowing someone with a diesel Tempo years ago, but I didn't really look at it very closely. I now look to find them on ebay. How are parts to find (engine)? I know other stuff is relatively easy to get at junkyards.
I had to find my dad a blown up diesel out of a Ranger so he could get an injector pump for his own Ranger. Found it in an ad through the paper. (the pump was new just before engine blew... I think someone got the timing wrong) 
>>OverBoardProject|||Followup-question||| Right now i'm living in Courtenay BC (Vancouver Island)
I just moved here form Kelowna area.
When I did a cross Canada trip in Feb I filled up once per province. Driving up to Winnipeg, then I flew from there and took the train back to Winnipeg.
I never used a full tank of fuel up, usually having about 1/4 tank left. Total bill was $300.00 Canadian
Things lile belts, waterpumps starters are either in stock or a day away.
The last time that I heard there was only 1 gasket set in Canada and I know the person that got it.
If I need a motor that 1 person wrote his car off shortly afterwords, and he has the motor and transmission sitting in his garage. He put a new head (not rebuilt) on it when he changed the gasket.
There's a company in Vernon that can re-build my fuel pump if needed for about $500.00 candian.
I don't really buy autowreck parts, unless I have to.
I get a pretty good discount on new parts, and if I figure that I might need several used parts I just get a parts vehicle.  Then as soon as I get what I need I usually give it away.  These people will always let me take more parts off if needed.

There were few drag strips so most specs just used a stop watch and the car's speedo, which was an unreliable method.

>>plainsdrifter|||Original question||| My cousin recently gave me his old 1974 Ford Van, &quot;the Love Bug&quot;, which had been sitting for several years.  Replaced the battery and it started right up. Drove it around town quite a bit, too, and it did fine.  Decided to take the Love Bug out of town down the highway.  Seemed to run like a top, like Love Bug's do, but on the return trip, while driving up the highway, I noticed a change in the amount of power.  Didn't want to pull over and not make it home.  
When I finally made it, pulled in and put the Love Bug in park and shut her down, a cloud of steam immediately engulfed us.  Got out and peeked underneath--antifreeze was pouring out.  I assume the water pump is involved, hoses look good and secure, but maybe a bad gasket between pump and block??  The Love Bug is down.  Any pointers would be appreciated.  Thanks!

>>>Title||| The 06 Fusion,lookin good.
>>Ion Pulse|||Original question||| I was pleased to see Ford unveiling something a bit different at this years Deriot Motorshow.  The Fusion has the desired effect, its sooooo much more interesting to look at than the 500 and has stayed true to the original Futura teaser design.  I especially like Ford's new 'three-bar' grille which looks distinctive and unique, something lacking from their cars.  Its good to see Ford finally launching a more upbeat car, judging from their other recent effors(ie, the new Focus, Freestyle and Freestar) this is pretty interesting(although the new Mustang and GT are fab).  The Fusion should also drive as well as it looks, as it based on the European Ford Mondeo and powered by the powerful 3.0V6litre engine from the Mondeo ST220.
Rumour has it the next Mondeo(to be launched in 2007) will share its styling with the Fusion but will be based on a modified Volvo S60 platform.

>>Ion Pulse|||Followup-question||| Ford claims that the Fusion will be significantly smaller than the Taurus/Sable it replaces,  I don't no if this is an illusion created by the 'wide' styling and shorter overhangs or if its actually smaller.  I would imagine being based on the 6's platform, engineers would be restricted in some way.
I think the Fusion is 190.2inches long....Is that smaller than a Camry(and the like) or the Taurus it replaces?
Ford also claims the rear seats have 37inches of legroom, which is more than a Accord and the same as a Camry.  The trunk(or boot) will have also 16cubic feet, which is more than a Accord and again the same as a Camry.
I hope the Fusion can make more ground on performance, like you said with the five-hundred.  The base 2.3litre 4-cylinder seems weedy, even by European standards and mated to the optional auto.  OMG

>>>Title||| Cam sensor ??
>>wack0|||Original question||| hi guys. 
 Can someone please explain to me what the cam sensor is exactly for and what can happen to a car if its faulty.   I just had mine replaced at the mechanics suggestion because my taurus would stall (not all the time) when in gear, or sometimes when driving, and for the most part once fully warmed up i guess would dissapear. And now to my dissapointment is still happening.
any help comments would be greatly appreciated... 
>>95GT|||Followup-question||| The cam sensor tells the computer when the number one piston is at top dead center, so it can start the firing order. When's the last time you got just a general tune up? Maybe a set of plugs and wires would help your situation out. It's sometimes the little things that make a big problem. Good luck 
>>289mustang|||Followup-question||| Ok, this is what I know....  The cam sensors in Tauruses (particularly the 3.0L 2-valve) is actually a synchronizer that takes place of the old distributor and is used for fuel injector timing more than anything and also drives the oil pump.  The crank sensor is used for spark timing since they have coil packs instead of coil on plug ignition.  The reason I know this is because I fought with one for many hours and as many times as it was out-of-time, it ran fine.  Now, the 3.0L DOHC uses the cam sensor for #1 TDC identification as well as injector timing.  The older Tauruses that still had distributors didn't have either crankshaft or cam sensors and used a TFI ignition module for spark timing and were fairly notorious for failing (causing stalling and no-start).  The TFI module sent a PIP (profile ignition pickup) signal to the PCM which used that to gang-fire the injectors (1,3,5 all at once, then 2,4,6 on the second round) Hope this helps.

Best I can recall this wasn't the case in previous winters -- idle speed still generated enough heat to keep things comfortable.  My limited knowledge tells me it's probably some kind of thermostat or temperature sensor issue, but I'd appreciate some more specific guidance before I try to do anything about it.

>>aerostick|||Original question||| I've got a mazda 5-speed overdrive trans that won't go into 5th at all and won't go all the way or stay in reverse.
It happened when I tried downshifting at 45mph from 5th to 4th and banged it two or three times into reverse before finding the right slot. A minute later when I tried to go back up to 5th it wouldn't go in at all. I can hold it partially in reverse with a light load, but if I let the clutch out all the way it will kick out.
The shop manual does not go into detail about how the 5th/reverse lockout cam is supposed to work or what position it should be in when in neutral. With the shifter out I can see that the rails are all centered properly for neutral and I can operate 1-2 and 3-4 with a screwdriver. I can get it into reverse with a screwdriver, but it won't budge in the 5th direction.
It was not difficult at all getting it into reverse or 5th before the downshifting incident.
Anybody know if this can be fixed without dropping the trans?  (I hate disconnecting the hydraulic clutch!) 
>>95GT|||Followup-question||| Well i don't know how your tranny exactly works. But, some have one shift fork for 5th and reverse.

>>firelikeiya|||Original question||| Hi, I am looking to take a poll on the number of miles other drivers out there are putting on their vehicles using a K &amp; N air filter. I have been researching K &amp; N filters to try to get an idea if they are any better than stock. I have used K &amp; N on several of my cars including '93 SE-R (for 70K mi. before sold), '02 Explorer sport trac (for 20K mi. before sold), '02 Camry 4-cyl (30K mi so far), and '02 Ford Ranger (30K mi so far). From a seat of the pants perspective, the cars all seemed to be more responsive to throttle inputs (mostly the SE-r, though, but I also owned that car when I lived in Virginia Beach, Va where it can get humid, now I live in dry Arizona) than before the switch. My concern with the filters is that, according to individual tests. they seem to pass more particles than most filters. The greatest mileage that I have put on a vehicle was on my '93 sentra SE-r. When I sold the vehicle I had 136,000 mi with 70,000 of those miles running on a K&amp;N cone filter. I am using the 50K mi cleaning interval as stated by K &amp; N. I would like to hear from those of you out there with K&amp;N  how many miles you have put on your vehicles total and with the filter. I would also like it if you could post what mileage interval between cleanings you are going by. Basically, the purpose of this is to see if the filters really do hurt reliability. Thank you for your replies! 
>>kahjdh|||Answer||| i think they filter more b/c they are cloth and not paper. 
>>MagicRat</span>|||Followup-question||| Excellent post. 
K&amp;N filters are a bit of a scam because they do not filter as well as paper, and do increase engine wear. 
Dirty air acts like sandpaper on the pistons, rings and cylinder walls. It only takes a little puff of dirty air each day to increase wear. 
I have a 1984 Jeep with a 2.8 V6, bought new.  A K&amp;N filter went in at about 40,000 km (25 k miles) in 1989. The engine cylinder walls were badly worn after just 60,000 km (40,000 miles)
I rebuilt the engine and had to bore the cylinders out .080 inches to remove all the wear. 
Note that usually a bore of .030 is required for rebuild typical engine wear. 
The funny thing is that all the other parts on the engine that were NOT exposed to dirty air, like the valve components, engine bearings etc were like new and showed no wear. The engine shop that rebuilt it had never seen anything like it and say that dirty air was responsible. 
IMO K&amp;N filters help for power but suck at filtering even when you do follow their instructions.

If you are higher than sea level at all, the 600 Edelbrock comes setup for sea level engines, which is why it will be rich out of the box. Get the calibration kit that comes with all the rods and jets, step-down springs.
Follow instructions with the carb, or if you don't have, go to the Edelbrock site and find it there. 
I had to go three stages lean on my cruise mode, and one stage lean on the power mode for my 460, at about 3100 ft altitude. With a little patience and a clear understanding of the instructions, you will do fine.

>>deedee73|||Original question||| I just took my '89 Probe to the shop today.  There was smoke rolling from under the hood and it smelled like anti-freeze.  A few motor-heads looked at it and said it could be the thermostat, the water pump, or it needed to be flushed.  I took it in today and they replaced the thermostat (that was part of the problem).  After driving it for a little while, the smoke started again but it smelled different - more like something was burning.  It's coming from underneath the turbo . . . what could it be?????

>>mlw35405|||Followup-question||| NO, it will NOT! I found this out the hard way. 92-94 engines have a camshaft sensor in the block beside the distributor, older ones do not, and if it doesn't have one, the PCM will not know which cylinder to fire.

>>kahjdh|||Followup-question||| LMAO, there is no way that frame bent from stopping. Is the car rusted out? Maybe the frame just gave b/c it was abused. The mustang is a unibody too so i think it was just rotted out and he wants a new car. 
>>meteor|||Answer||| Unless this guy has a braking system that rivals a 6 sec dragster there is NO WAY a sudden stop would bend a frame, the car would slide reducing stress on the frame itself only an abrupt impact would create that much stress. Unless the frame is weak from rust, or the car was in a previous accident and wasn't repaired properly. Unless the car was a frame up restoration, Id say it was already bent. Definitly check it out!!

Here is where I am stumped. Because of the excessive overheating I repalced the pads, rotors, calipers, lines, master cylinder, porportioning valve, and repacked the bearings all just in the front.

>>>Title||| rough idle
>>rogerphillips|||Original question||| Hello all:
My son has a 1996 Crown Vic police car. It has been a great first car,but is now having a rough idle problem. The OBD code suggest a P0303, which is a cylinder 3 misfire.
We took it to two different mechanics, and paid a total of $250.00 in diagnostic fees. Confirmed not a bad valve. First guy said bad plugs. We changed them. Second guy said bad plug wires. Put in new plug wires, no change. We asked at a parts place. They suggested new coil packs. Changed them, still no change in the rough idle.
We are now relieved of $450.00, and still have the problem. I am thinking of a bad fuel injector on number 3 cylinder? Possible? Parts guy said injectors are a very rare problem on a Crown Vic.
It idles fine in neutral or park, but the minute you put it in drive or reverse, it rocks like a boat on the high seas.
Thanks to anyone with ideas!
Roger.

>>mnt55|||Original question||| I am a novice builder and I have a 1971 cleveland 351 that came out of a cougar I think.?? I have put a edelbrock performer intake manifold on it.  There are 2 small holes that are not covered by the manifold or the valve covers.  The holes are just under the valve covers one on each side.  Is this normal???  Also the valve covers I purchased do not have breathers.  Is this a problem..thanks for any input 
>>MagicRat</span>|||Followup-question||| For the breather issue, YES, it can be a big problem. Your engine must have a way of releasing blow-by gases from the crank case.
If these are not present you will quickly blow out the crankshaft seals and blow oil all over the road. 
Every single Cleveland engine I have ever seen relies on such breathers. Some cheapie aftermarket valve covers had knock out plugs in each valve cover, where you knocked them out and installed a rubber grommit and a breather cap. 
Usually you knock out both; one is used for the PCV valve and the other is a breather.
If there is no  oil filler cap, the breather is also a filler cap. 
I wonder if your valve covers are from a non - Cleveland engine. 
Some older Ford engines had an oil filler pipe at the front of the engine  with a breather on top. In these engines, the valve covers had no breather. 
This might explain the hole you see. All the photos I have of Clevelands show no small holes on top of the engine that are not covered by either the covers or the manifold or distributor or thermostat housing, so maybe the wrong covers are leaving something exposed?
Can you post some pictures??

>>cardsnmore2004|||Original question||| Hi,
  I am alittle stumped on how to get this belt off. I can see no way from the bottom of car. I took the Altenator belt off and can see the Idler pulley but have no clue how to loosen it. Im told there are 2 screws on top to loosen. If thats true them I have a motor mount right in the way. Anyone know how to change the main belt.
  Thanks 
>>kahjdh|||Followup-question||| Im doing this today, sunday 9th. Ihave to replace all 3. I had to use 2 people on this. I took a long socket wrench and wedged it between the nut and inside of the idler pulley. Just pry it against the the engine mount and have somebody underneith to take the belt off the crank. Then it is a pain in the ass to fish out. I haven't tried putting it on yet but im not looking frward to it. I'll clue you in when im done. 
>>kahjdh|||Followup-question||| Okay, i finished putting the water pump, serpantene and alternator belt on. Starting with the water pump i put it around the crank then tensioner then got it half way on the water pump. Since i dunno how far the belt tightener goes out i put it half on the rear of the pulley than unplugeed the coil for the distributor and turned the engine over. Popped right on. The the serpantene I first put on the power steering pump, then the a/c compressor and last on the crank. Then pull up on the tensioner and tuck it under. Finally the alternator was a breeze and in about 2hrs from start to finish i had replaced all 3 belts. I bought a tensoiner tool from advance auto and would work great on any car with clearance between the fender but i used it without the sockets and used the bar to pull on the tensoiner. Definately would not want to do this again for awhile.

I tried to get under the car to see it but it is cramped down there. Any help would be great. 
>>UnexplodedCow|||Answer||| I had a '91, and the water pump belt was a bitch to replace. I had to take off all the other belts to take it off. It's also got a crappy tensioner design, but it does hold well. Just a pain in the ass considering there is no clearance. 
>>kahjdh|||Followup-question||| Thats what i tought. I just replaced the tie rod ends and was down there lookin at it. I think when i take it in for an alignment i will just have them replace it. 
>>UnexplodedCow|||Followup-question||| That might cost a lost considering what would have to be done. All you need, if I remember correctly, is a good pry bar to loosen the tensioner, a 8mm wrench for loosening the water pump belt tensioner, a 17 mm wrench for loosening the holding nut on the pump belt tensioner, and a 15mm socket to loosen the bolt holding your alternator on. Could be a 17, also. After that, all you need is a little patience to work the belts on and off. The biggest pain I had was with the auto tensioned belt, as I had to make a square ended pry bar out of an old screwdriver. 
>>kahjdh|||Answer||| ok i think ford purposely made the pulleys so close to the apron so you cant get it off. This is a pain in the ass. So far im working on it today and it took like 15min to get the damn belt off. Now i get to enjoy the stress of puting all 3 belts back on. O yay.

>>>Title||| Need Wiring Help On 69 Torino Gt
>>LISA69|||Answer||| I Can't Get My Tail Lights Or Dash Lights To Work And If I Don't Disconnect My Battery Cable At Night My Battery Is Dead In The Morning 
>>65comet|||Original question||| I would first try the light switch.  Use a continuity tester to see if turning it on and off does shut off the power.  Check the incoming power connection to the body of the switch as well.  A short inside of it might be letting power go straight to ground from its connection to the dash.  The 68 Fairlane I had had a short in the dash light reostat.  If I left the switch turned to have the interior lights on, then I would get dash lights.  It is possible the dash light and tail light problems are coincedental and caused by unrelated items.  The tail light problem could be a wire has bared somewhere and is grounding out, or just broken.  Could be corrosion on the back side of the fusebox.  I have seen those light switches retaining nuts loosen and someone turn the switch a full 360 degrees causing the wires to wrap around themselves causing a short.  Though it only affected the headlights for me, that floor high/low beam switch likes to corrode and short out also. 
>>bobss396|||Followup-question||| The foot dimmer can cause some freaky problems and is often overlooked.
As far as the parasitic drain issue, you have a short somewhere. There is an easy old time test for this. Disconnect your negative battery terminal. Hold the cable in your hand, strike the terminal against the battery post, if you see a spark, something is still live. Make sure your under hood light is out and the key is off, car doors closed. This is best done in total darkness.
Now one by one, remove a fuse at the fuse block, repeat the test until you get a no spark condition. That will be the circuit with the short.

I would have thought it would have been in the rear on the inside of the chassis rail, but i could not find it. Anyone know where it might be? it's about the size of an oil filter from the looks of the replacement. Thanks

>>gendow|||Original question||| I'm new to this board. I was wondering if someone had any suggestions as to what might be causing my &quot;check engine light&quot; to remain on. I bought an OBD II diagnostic tester and I got a &quot;PO171&quot; reading, which was a &quot;fuel system lean&quot; indication. I then changed the oxygen sensors (both upstream and downstream) on my 1997 Ranger (2.3L, 4 cyl., 5 sp.) and erased the code, however, the &quot;check engine light&quot; keeps coming back on. Does anyone have any other ideas as to what may be causing the check engine light to be activated? Thanks. 
>>ricebike|||Followup-question||| it would still have the same code? fuel system lean?
i dunno why u changed a part that didn't need it... i know there's a code for the o2 sensors. &lt; P0130-P0141&gt;
back to topic- running lean: when's the last time you have changed your fuel filter? that's a start... to rule out a fuel restriction. then u gotta hook up a fuel pressure gauge and/or check injectors for clogs (doesn't it has a code for injectors?--i guess not)
then check for vaccuum line leaks... mebbe around the egr area is putting too much burnt gasses back into the intake &amp; leaning out the mixture... isn't there a code for that too? &lt; P0400/ P0402&gt;
having an excessive lean sytem is no good--increased temps so keep an eye on the temp gauge if u have one. (temps won't be increased in the egr dumping too much exhaust back to the intake, though)
NE ways, clear the codes, drive around again, see if engine light goes on yet again, read codes... 
>>gendow|||Answer||| Thanks for the advice RiceBike. I'll check for vacuum leaks and change the fuel filter.

>>>Title||| Front Wheel Seaping Goo
>>amentf|||Original question||| I recently inherited a 1987 Ford Taurus with only 6500 miles on it.  I changed all fluid, but my constant headache has been with the brakes.  Just before I took posession, my father-in-law drove the car and the front brakes locked up.  When he first arrived at the garage, the right front wheel was smoking and there was a strange brown extremely sticky goo that was visible from the wheel and dripping down the tire.  In addition, the wheel was so hot it was melting the center plactic hub that covers the lugs.
A garage said it was the master cylinder, so he replaced it.  The problem persisted when I took posession of the car.  So, I replaced the brakes, turned the rotors, replaced the calipers, and installed the Ceramix pads.
Although the wheel seems no hotter than the others after driving 20-30 miles, it is still seaping that goo from the wheel.  I doubt it is brake fluid leaking because the goo is only visible on wheel itself - not on the brake parts.  Also, the brake fluid resevoir is not losing fluid.  At this point, I doubt that there is still a brake problem, but I am reluctant to drive the car without knowing what the goo could be.    
My neighbor (a mechanic) believes it is actually the rubber covering  over the wheel (optional wheels on the Taurus that year) that was melting when there WAS a brake problem, but it continues to seap.
Any thoughts on what this very sticky brown goo could be?? 
>>OverBoardProject|||Answer||| Check the cv joint, and look for a ripped boot (the boot at the wheel end of the axel)

Although I believe that the suspension is basicly the same design.
What can I say, except no one is perfect

>>>Title||| Unable to shift into 5th or reverse
>>Return to Serenity|||Original question||| Hey, this is my second post, my first was the exact same post in the specific Focus area.  At any rate, here is my question.
I bought three weeks ago a 2005 Ford Focus ZX3 5-speed Manual, last night I took my girlfriend out to an empty parking lot to teach her how to drive a manual transmission.  The car has never had any problems with shifting whatsoever, infact I always thought the clutch was a little too soft.  Anyway, she did extremely well with her first time, and only stalled the car twice, though they were pretty bad stalls.  We never got up to fourth gear, since we were in a parking lot, and it shifted fine the whole time.  However, when I got back in to drive to pick up a movie, it wouldn't go into reverse to pull out of the parking spot.  So I let it coast out of the spot since it was on a hill, and we took the highway to test if it needed to be at a higher RPM to get into the slot.  It wouldn't go into the slot to select 5th on the highway either.  So essentially I now have a four speed manual transmission with the 5 speed gear ratios, and no reverse.  I am going to take it into the dealership tomorrow, but I wanted to see if was something that I could possibly easily fix.  At any rate, I appreciate any help that can be given, and thank you for taking the time to read this.

does the higher temp ONLY occur when the A/C is operating, and no other time?  and if so, has this condition just recently started, or has it been slowly building, and now getting worse?
ctesla 
>>OverBoardProject|||Answer||| It almost sounds like the fan isn't turning on. Try to investigate it a little further.
Leave the air off up all steep hills, and your better off with the wondows open in stop and go traffic and the air turned off 
>>65comet|||Followup-question||| Most of the time on that car it is the electric cooling fan for the radiator isn't working.  When the car gets hot, open the hood and see if the fan is running, leaving the car running and the ac on while checking it.  Try and get it hot again with the ac off and check for the fan.  I've heard of some tempo's having a problem with the cooling fan not coming on when the ac is on, and fine when the ac is off, but hadn't heard what anyone did to solve it.
There is also the possibility you have a similar problem that occurred to my son.  He was way to closely following a friend that was in a big pickup down a gravel road.  His so called friend kept punching his gas sending rocks into the ac cooling element/radiator and bent most of the fins flat.  Until they were straightened out again, almost no air was passing through to the radiator.
As mentioned in a earlier reply, a flush and new coolant in the radiator is always helpful. 
>>Jim Adams|||Followup-question||| On all the newer cars that have electric fans the fan is supposed to come on when you turn the A.C. on,,the condensor in front of the radiator always gets hot ,,this is how your refrigerant gets cooled down. It passes threw the condensor before it turns to liquid and goes threw the liquid line to the evaporator,,so the manufacturers made the vehicles wiring as such that when you flip on the A.C. the fan comes on automatically. 
>>mastermech|||Followup-question||| other items to look at if the fan doesn't come on but the fan motor is good but gets no power when the car is running are  the (fan control module) located under the driver side dash and the coolant temp switch. the way it works is power runs through the module which is two circuit one to turn on the fan when the a/c is on and the other circuit when the engine reaches operating temperature. the non-a/c dependent side also relies on the coolant temperature switch to close to ground the circuit so the fan turns on.

>>>Title||| Propane Vehicles
>>CanaMark|||Original question||| I have been trying to find what the mileage is on late model trucks that have the propane conversion kits on them. But I am having no luck. Propane is significantly cheaper then gas here its around 55 cents where as regular gasoline is $1.00. In Canada!! I found a few older model F150 and F250 trucks with &quot;Dual Fuel&quot; meaning you can switch from gasoline to propane. Propane burns cleaner, but in winter they can be somewhat of a pain to start if left outside for a long time. If any of you have trucks with propane, what do you like and dislike about it. And what are some of your other thoughts.
Thank You 
>>MagicRat</span>|||Followup-question||| Propane at 55 cents is not quite the screaming deal it seems to be. Propane has about 30% less energy (BTU's) per litre, so your mileage is lower. Your 55 cent propane is equal to about 71 cent gasoline. 
So its still a saving. 
Although dual fuel trucks tend to be expensive, a propane only truck (if you can find one) should be really cheap, since no one wants propane-only, unless its a city-only taxi or something. 
You can run high compression with propane, which improves power and fuel economy a bit. 
Propane engines run so clean, the oil never gets dirty, unless the engine is really dirty inside the crankcase. Often, oil changes can be extended, especially if you run a synthetic oil. 
Propane is just a bit bulky. My last propane vehicle was a full size Chevy van with a HUGE tank, 6 ft long and 3 ft around, mounted inside, at the back.  It would take 230 liters of propane giving me terrific range. But it was scary to share the inside compartment with that much propane. 
>>CanaMark|||Answer||| What kind of gas Mileage you get on that truck MagicRat. 
>>MagicRat</span>|||Answer||| I never measured it, but it seemed to be about 25% worse than my present gas powered chevy van. (both with Chevy 305 v8,s ) but since propane  then was 45% cheaper than gas (the same as it is now) there was still a substantial saving in $$$ 
>>TheStang00|||Followup-question||| so do propane powered vehicles make about 30% less power too? 
>>MagicRat</span>|||Answer||| 
Quote:
>>OverBoardProject|||Answer||| Before you consider Propane try adding acetone to your existing truck.s gas. It doesn't take much and might give you way better fuel mileage.
I'm actually almost doubling the economy in my Blazer while off roading (going to the fishing holes) with a full load.
I'm trying it in my Diesel Topaz, and noticed more power, but haven't checked the mileage yet

>>firefighter3110|||Original question||| I already posted this in another thread, just lookin for some help.
Alright, I am currently the maintenace person at a small ambulance company ( I am a full time EMT their and maintenace is my secondary job), basically I do the oil changes, tire rotations and anything else that needs to be done. Anything major such as engine/tranny work goes to a shop. Recently the covering of the muffler came off and I asked my manager if I could replace the whole system with stacks on either side of the box, he said yes, which i wasnt expecting. I have looked under the vehicle and checked some thing out. I have seen that it wouldnt be hard to split the original tubing and start new ones that branch to either side, run up the side of the box and end in some stacks. So now im asking, does anyone know where I can get stacks and just a bunch of tubing so I can make an exhaust system myself, or some suggestions on what I should do, such as do I need to add headers and do I need to have mufflers on their. Anything else would be appreciated such as watch outs and any other pointers. My boss pretty much wants to make this ambulance a badass ride since right now its pretty gutless. So anything would be much appreciated.

>>GTP Dad</span>|||Followup-question||| Actually why don't you get him to allow you to put headers on the ambulance and a set of side pipes instead of stacks.  I am assuming that this is a diesel since you want stacks.  You will probably have less problems with the side pipes and you should be able to find them fairly easily.  Search truck parts on the net although you may have to adapt them for your application.  Back in my Paramedic days I always wanted to put hooker headers (ala mother jugs and speed) on an ambulance with a working hood scoop, tunnel ram and high lift cam. Of course all ambulances were gasoline powered back then. Would have been the fastest and baddest ambulance around. Good Luck!!!

>>Kokuten|||Original question||| OK, here's the skinny. Buddy of mine calls me up says &quot;dude, I just got a new ride, you gotta come see this&quot;. I hop in the Chicken Shack, my '88 Toyota van (274k on it, waiting for the big 300), and drive over. 
he's got my car.
My first car was a 1982 Ford Grenada. I loved the 'miniature land yacht' style, and Ford's weak attempt at consumer-priced luxury was very pleasing to me. I put a lot of maintenance and upkeep into that car, and lost it in a tragic stupid-me-mountain-winter-road incident.
He's got a 1977 Grenada. I'm immediately in love, and when I find out the car has a 5.0litre V8 in it, I'm, well, excited. I tell him I'm gonna buy it off him, and he agrees, when he leaves for the Air Force.
He left, I got it. Frame is straight, body is good, minor rust spotting, some sunfade, some pinstripe damage. No Problem.
Exhaust system is hosed. Tennis-ball sized hole in the Y-pipe, muffs and cat rusted so bad that the first time I throttled past half-pedal, I blew the whole system off. Front-end has the stock bushings and rubber 'bits', from 25 years ago. They're more rotten than a politician's promise. Tires are old, old, old, minor exterior issue-ness (hood support bars sagged, trunk stay-bar missing, etc, etc).
The interior is hashed. Mold is eating the rear deck-area trim, the deck itself is sodden to the point of mushy. The driver's side window trim is gone, the adjuster for the driver's mirror (manual inside adjust) is missing, the passenger adjuster won't stay true.
I'm a competent enough shade-tree mechanic that I can do a LOT of this work myself, and I have a list of upgrades that Ford never considered that I want to do (AOD tranny, Mustang rear end, some front-end upgrades, drive computer, etc, etc... ). But I'm running into a problem.
I can't find parts.  
I'm looking for an online resource for new/used parts for the interior and mechanicals for this vehicle, as well as information on what I can swap-out with from a more common model of vehicle, specifically in the exhaust system and front-end, and brakes.
Any help would be appreciated, please feel free to respond here or email me at Kokuten @ te r ti a ry. n e t. I'm trickling money into my new baby, and want to be able to feed it proper parts!

Its too late to replace the alt and i dont want to pay for a new one. Any ideas? 
>>MagicRat</span>|||Answer||| possibly the new alternator has the wrong size pully on it or it is out of alignment, or (if its a non-serpentine type) you are over or under tightening it 
>>OverBoardProject|||Answer||| My Topaz had the same problem, and after multi belts it turned out being the alternator bracket was broken.
We had to take the alternator and bracket right off to find the break.

>>>Title||| 88 Tbird 3.8 cold running
>>gt427|||Original question||| My wife's Bird lately runs badly until normal operating temp is reached.  It has EEC-IV and fuel injection.
At start up it runs @ 1500 rpm for 20-30 seconds - which is normal.  As the system backs down the rpms it begins to cough, sputter and die, so the computer cranks up the rpm.  This up and down process repeats until temp reaches near normal.  Then everything is fine.
If I try to run the car during this process, it'll sputter &amp; usually die. and continues to run badly even after normal temp is reached.  The only way to get it to run right is to let it idle up to full temp.
I do not get any codes, all 11's.
2nd issue - in the last 2 days, while the engine is on, I get a loud &quot;beep&quot; from under the dash or maybe kick panel on the passenger side. Every 60 seconds.  I know the ECU is in the kick panel, but I'm not aware it can emit any sounds.
Any thoughts? 
>>mobil_12|||Answer||| Sorry, I cant help you on the noise from the kick panel....  
Usually whe you have a car that wont run well until op temp is reached, suspect the computers temp sensor.  If the sensor is bad the comp will substitue a set value for the temp.  This will cause all kinds of drivability problems, from injector pulse to timing adjustments.  Check it out first.  After all, they are cheap and easy to fix.

Something Ive run into lately is fuel injectors that are sticking at cold start up.  They wont work untill they warm up, then work just fine.
Try doing a cylinder balance test.  Start the car when its running poorly and pull off a spark plug wire one at a time on each cylinder.  The cylinder that doesnt drop the idle is your problem cylinder.  
After that, check for spark, fuel, compression, etc.  All and engine needs!  Four cycle engnine = Suck, squeeze, bang, blow.   
>>gt427|||Followup-question||| Balance test didn't reveal a probelm with a cylinder.  One of the guys at the local parts house suggested I clean out the Throtle Air Bypass valve.  Bingo!  Apparently it was stuck. 
That beeping seems to be associated with the battery/charging system.  It may have a dead cell.  Every time it beeps, the display on the dash switches to battery condition and the little battery icon flashes.  So that's next.

It is kinda near the back of the engine and again passenger side.

>>proticus|||Followup-question||| sladezero, mind me asking what in the world a &quot;scrill&quot; sounds like?  yes, we can all go replacing things and hope to fix the idle, or we can do it the easy way and not pay anything.  release a small amount of pressure off of the throttle cable by readjusting the nuts where the a/c adjusts throttle when the compressor kicks in.  when adjusting these nuts be VERY careful.  shift it around too much and it will take you forever to get it back to where you started. 
>>sladezero|||Answer||| Hey there,

>>UnexplodedCow|||Followup-question||| Did anyone bother to check the idle screw? Yes, there is one on those years. If you adjust it down, it might make a difference. If it's adjusted too high, the idle will be too high. It's on the throttle cable/butterfly assembly. Just look for it. 
>>Smiley568|||Answer||| I had the same problem with mine the problem was that there was entirely too much timing in it for the knock sensor to compensate for.
I suggest that you unplug the modulator from the distributor then loosen the distributor start with a 1\4 inch turn and go from there, once your within about 15 degrees the sensor should be able to control your timing.
Your problem sounds identical to mine so if you have no leaks, your TPS sensor is good, your a\c switch is good, and your MAF, and IAC check out fine, its going to be the timming I'm sure of it, I hope this helps you out and good luck to you sir.

>>williamskinner16|||Followup-question||| Modifying newer vehichles(well cars with sensors and a computer controlling the engines/transmissions operation)Scare the hell out of me. when it comes to altering the simplest item like going with a 160 degree thermostat leaves me to wonder how is this going to affect the computers ability to maintain proper operation. Did you change the computer chip to compensate for these alterations?
Im sure that it can be done, you have mentioned the vortech blower and another non stock cam. Is the cam made to operate with a blower? Also by shaving the heads you will bump up the compression ratio. Using a supercharger requires less compression, as the supercharger builds the compression before the air-fuel charge enter the combustion chamber, this is one of the reasons you would want to have a supercharger in the first place. The blower is releaving part of the parasitic nature of the compression stroke. 
Im sure that these aftermarket parts have instructions,guidelines, or recomendations, to matching these parts. Whether a vehicles motor is built to tow, drag race, or simply get you from point A to point B, The parts have to be matched to operate cooperatively. I wish I could offer first hand experience to help you in your delema, hopefully some one out there has gone through what you are experiencing here. Your project seems really cool and I would like to know how it turns out, Just dont give up, one of my first projects was when I was a teenager changing the intake and cam in my 81' F100. Even though I was very carefull, I made a very simple mistake, that resulted in me selling one really cool truck dirt cheap. I couldent get it started it would turn over and over but wouldent start. it drove me nuts, after I sold it I found out I had left the battery connected during the work and melted a fusable link.

So I have two questions:

>>OverBoardProject|||Followup-question||| When i worked at a Ford Dealer many years ago the cars would roll off the truck with about 25km on them. (15 miles or so)
We would have to do a PDI (pre delivery inspection) and test drive the car.
So when the cars rolled onto the lot they would have about 20 miles on the clock.
Allow for some test drives and you should still never have more than 100 miles on the car. Otherwise it's used.
That car is probably a salesmans demo car. They are only suposed to put about 15000km on them or they go down in value some more.
If you want a new car talk to the salesman when a car is rolling off the truck.
Tell them that you'll do the final cleanup (up to 2 hours work since there is sometimes a thick film over them)
They still have to do the PDI for safety reasons. I've seen new cars with the seatbelts not attached, or the brake master cylinder empty. You sure don't want to fix those items on a new car.

Read catalogs offering the types of parts applied in the type of work you would like to do.As far as doing maintnance and troubleshooting get a working manual for your vehichle and study the job you are about to do think about what you are about to do, and while you shouldent allow yourself to get intimadated over the work, consider the level of difficulty so you dont get in over your head. If you know other people that work on cars talk to them and ask questions.(Think though of what they have to offer in advice and compare with other sources as people can give poor advice or suggest a bad work habits) Going back to talking to people you might know,ask if you might be able to help or watch the next time they have a project or repair. Look for used text books, even if the might be off topic. If your into learning performance, and you find a used book about body repair, or diesle mechanics dont pass it up, check it out. Information can seem unrelated but really from a beginers perspective they offer the basics in becoming more mechanical, you might even discover an affinity for another aspect of this work to be applied in a new trade. If you live in a city or a fortunate town you might want to check out the community college.Non credit courses are usually cheap. If you really want to get into it shop around for trade schools and colleges that offer a good education and training. Make sure it is an accredited school. 
In the meantime, read, research, talk, and observe others if you can. when you want to do work on your own, make sure you have a reference source, all the parts, and have a descent set of tools complete with everthing you need for the particular job you are doing. If you start getting pissed off frustrated, just walk away from what your doing untill you can return with a cool head.(the more you do this type of thing the less often you will be getting pissed off, its just the nature of the work,embrace it, happy zen thaughts)

>>OverBoardProject|||Followup-question||| williamskinner16 and cpujunky both offer good advice.
My advice is simple, start with the basics.
Learn how to change tires, give people jump starts, and change your oil.
Always carry a small emergancy tool kit with a jack, tire iron, and jumper cables. Not so much for yourself but you learn when helping others. (they often toss you money too and won't take no for an answer)
From there you'll quickly learn how to do tuneups, brakes, and most small repairs.   Even engine swaps.
Read every tech article that intrests you, and even the home repair section.
And even mechanics working in dealerships ask for advice on this forum when they can't find a solution. So don't be shy even for a simple question. 
>>>Title||| Dishonest repair facilities....
>>ModMech|||Original question||| Don't believe everything you hear, or are told.
We do not &quot;do tires&quot; at our truck repair shop, so when I found a leaking tire on my own car, I took it to my local National tire dealer's repair shop.  I will not identify them, but suffice it to say they and Ford have recently had very significant disagreements about tires used on a particular Ford product.
So, I'm told &quot;it will take about 45 minutes, because that's how long it take for the glude to dry&quot;.  Right.  (complete lie)
After waiting for about 30 minutes, the counterperson calls me and reports the findings of their &quot;complimentary inspection&quot;.  
1)  I need a fuel filter (due on miles).  This is a LIE.  They have never performed any maintainence on this car, and they could not know if the fuel filter is due or not.
2)  Oil leak.  Yup, the drain plug gasket seeps.  Big deal.
3)  I need belts &quot;because they have too many cracks per inch&quot;.  Well weather checks do not count, besides, that criteria is for a serpentine belt, which I do not have.  I have four &quot;V&quot; belts, and they are all perfectly good.
4)  The oil needs to be changed, it is burned.  Really.   I ask &quot;based on what?&quot;  Response: &quot;It's very dark.&quot;  Ok, well apparently this &quot;professional national chain&quot; doesn't know anything about oil.  Different brands of oil are different colors (light to very dark) when NEW.  Therefore, one cannot judge oil life by color alone.  They did not know the brand, how long it was in, or the weight of oil.  That is just plain dishonest.
The &quot;last straw&quot; was after paying the $30 bill, and a short drive home, I discovered my low rolling resistance tires all looked a little &quot;flat&quot;.  I checked the tire pressures, and found ALL were 30-35 psi.  That's funny, when I left home, they were ALL at 44 psi as I inflated them before leaving.  The sidewall rating on these tires is 44 psi, and according to GY, their &quot;safe inflation range&quot; is 40-44 psi.
I returned to the store and spoke with the manager on duty, as he saw me enter and offered to help with my obvious problem even before I reached the counter.  I explained about the tires looking low, and that I had just checked them, and inflated the LR before comming to the store.  He told me &quot;We can't inflate them to 44 psi, it's unsafe.  It's much higher then the door sticker says.&quot;  I looked at him as if he were from Mars, and said &quot;That's CRAZY!  You know more than GY about the safe inflation pressure of this model of tire?&quot;  &quot;This is a 'low rolling resistance tire', and MUST be inflated to 40-44 psi, according to GY.&quot;  He said that they would do it, but that I assumed all responsibility.  I had no problem with that.
Given the problems Ford had with underinflated tires on Explorers, and all the media coverage of the same, I cannot fathom how ANY &quot;respectable, honest national tire store&quot; could make such assanine assertions about tires and their inflation.  Furthermore, I did not ask, or authorize ANYONE to check or adjust anything on MY CAR, they did this without my knowledge or conscent.  When I brought that fact to their attention, they balked at making it right.
Their utter lack of knowledge about the products they sell will get someone killed, not to mention their deceptive sales practices defrauding untold numbers of patrons by &quot;selling&quot; repairs that are not necessary or truely advised.

>>MagicRat</span>|||Followup-question||| Hey, ease up. 
Most mechanics shops take a look at the cars that come into their shops. They are not forcing you to have work done, they are offering their opinion. You can always say no. 
Also, from your post, you may not understand about recommended pressure.  
The pressure indicated on the tire sidewall is the maxiumum recommended pressure. 
It is only suitable at the maximum rated load. The more load you have, the more air pressure is required for the tires to retain the correct shape.
If you fill your tire up to this amount when your tire has less than the max load, it is over inflated. 
Over inflation reduces traction, tire life and produces unneccesary structural stress on the tire. 
IMHO a lightly laden Ford Exploder on stock tires should see pressures at about 35 psi and no more, unless you fill it full of people and luggage. 
The Firestone tire problem was made worse because Ford recommended less than 30 psi in tires for normal use, which was too soft. 
>>OverBoardProject|||Followup-question||| The rip off shops do make it sound like your car is un-safe and the poor honest person will often get the work done there just because they really believe that it is un-safe.
I actually saw an ambulance that just left a overpriced repair place where I live with the rear  brakes adjusted so tight that they were gripping as hard as the emergancy brake. The shop owner told the ambulance crew chief (a good friend of his) that the trany was going and that's why it was having problems even moving.
My mom was a peremedic at that time, got a call and I arrived in town 1/2 hour after the call ended.   The brakes were still red hot.
Just say that there was a complaint launched about the shop, and the crew cheif after B.C. Ambulance had to pay around $5000.00 to fix this fake problem.
The shop owner somehow gets all the Christians in the area going there and saying that he's so honest, and the best. But the rest of us know better and several people learned the hard way.

>>Paul Masley|||Followup-question||| ModMech:  I think that you are a little off line with some of your comments.  
You are right about the comments regarding tire shops.  Most do not know their head from their butts about tire pressure in a tire.  Regardless of what I am having done to my tires, I always gauge them before I leave the shop.
I bought a set of BFG 33 12.50's.  The DA's at the shop put 50 pounds of air in them.  The door sticker said 35.  This tire was three sizes over what originally came on the truck.  The tires should have had 32 in the front and 30 in the rear (this is my experience for tire wear and ride).
You did not state what type of vehicle you were driving, the size of the wheels or tires and the type of tire.  This information is needed in order to determine the actual air pressure.  The easiest way to determine pressure is with the chalk test.  It takes about an hour to do.

>>williamskinner16|||Original question||| I am new to this post If any one can offer any suggestions I would be very appriciative.
quick questions for a 94 Mustang GT:
1) where is the fuel pump relay?
2) where can I find a fuel line assembly from filter to tank?
3) if there is more than one relay in the same place how do you know which one is the fuel pump?
4) am I overlooking another problem or another solution?
Here is the story,
I am attempting to help a friend get his 1994 Mustang GT on the road after being parked for a while. I was told that the fuel pump was in need of replacement. I put in a new battery checked the fuse and reset the inertia switch (it wasen't in an accident). It was leaking fuel through the filler neck/tank grommet. I replaced the pump and grommet at first the pump still diden't prime. I double checked the connection at the harness near the tank and began looking for the relay. (I still can not find). I tried to start again and the fuel pump did prime, so I turned the motor over but the motor woulden't start(at this point the motor isn't a concearn, as I am taking one problem at a time.) I shut the key off, and heard a pressurised hiss from the fuel tank, where returning fuel leaked. I took the fuel line assembly, that connects the filter to the tank,to NAPA and a ford dealership. (two braided lines with quick disconnecting ends,both return and supply, about 18&quot;-24&quot; long).The one end was in rough shape. 
NAPA only had a vague reference to the guts for the quick conection(&quot;O&quot; rings and retaining springs), and the Dealership said the assembly was an obsolete part not carried by ford anymore, I bought an assortment of &quot;O&quot; rings and retaining springs.

>>>Title||| Ford Brakes
>>focus1nc|||Original question||| Ok so since ive gotten my stickshift, i have been pulling my parking break a little early when as im comming to a stop when parking.  Can this mess a car up?  Because after pulling a little hard one time i think i fucked up my brakes.  Next time i tried hitting the brakes they didnt start making my car brake until i pushed the pedal the whole way down.    It used to start braking as soon as my foot touched the pedal.  
Im a pizza delivery guy so i pull the ebrake a lot.
also the light for the ebrake is now stuck on. 
the car still brakes at the same speed that it used to but i have to push the pedal in all the way, and its sort of un nerving when your in traffic and have to break and you push the pedal down far enough that it should stop the car, but nothing happens.  
How much might this cost to fix?  Or do i even need to fix it 
>>OverBoardProject|||Followup-question||| You probably ran 1 side of the master cylinder low of fluid.
I would also pull the wheels off and do a brake check. From what I've seen when the master cylinder has a low side it usually means that one set of brakes is just about worn out 
>>Hollowcreek|||Followup-question||| What year and model is your vehicle? On some ABS equipped models if you pull the emergency brake and depress the brake pedal at the same time while you are moving you will mess up the ABS system. There is a metering valve that controls how much brake pressure is sent to each wheel cylinder or caliper which is controlled electronically and since you are using the cable to operate the rear brakes instead of the ABS system too little pressure could be being sent to the rear. If you have checked for leaks, sufficient fluid levels and the shoes and/or pads look ok and are properly adjusted and you still have the same pedal, try this.  With the engine running and the car chocked on a level surface open all four bleeder screws and have someone push the brake pedal to the floor and hold it there while you close them. DO NOT release the pedal until all screws are closed. Check your fluid levels and road test the vehicle. You may have to do this more than once to get it back 100%. The other option is to have the brakes adjusted at a brake shop or dealer who has the correct electronic device to adjust the metering valve. 
>>>Title||| check engine light after low fuel
>>Mike05|||Original question||| The check engine light came on in my 1996 Ford Ranger after I foolishly let it nearly run out of fuel. Is this something I'm going to need to take to a mechanic to fix, or is the light likely to go out on its own after a few startings now that the tank is full? (I've started it four times since, and the light remains.) Is there reason to think I'm doing my engine damage driving it? I've been told that disconnecting the battery can reset the computer in these cases--and I've also heard that disconnecting the battery doesn't solve anything on modern vehicles. Can anyone lend some expertise? 
>>fordman123|||Answer||| Disconnecting the battery is an option.
The PCM monitors all sorts of things like fuel pressure and resistance in the fuel sender. It could be merely coincidence or there could be a problem. You will not damage the engine by driving it ..
Try disconnecting the battery for about five minutes to kill the 
&quot;keep alive memory&quot;  and then reconnect it.
If it was due to low fuel, then the light probably won't come back on.
If it comes back on, then you  could try a mechanic to scan it and diagnose it further.
Good Luck!! 
>>flytomcats|||Followup-question||| To all,
I have a 98 expedition EB, 77k, 5.4 motor. I was recently on a trip and got the check engine light, flashing, after going over Donner pass, 7,000ft or so. Had the wife look it up and it talked about possible misfire or something with the catlytic converter. The expi was running ok at the time I thought. After about 15 min the light would go off for a min or so and then would come back. Then it would go on steady. Of course the book says steady could be the gas cap not on tight, etc. After about 20 min I noticed the expi running rough and could feel the misfire, especially between 1500 and 2000 rpm. We were only three hrs into a 7 hour trip so we stopped in Sacramento and holed up for the night since it was Sun and no garages open. I did as much research on the web and armed myself with as much knowledge about the light. I want to say thanks to all who have posted before me, you really helped! In my research I found the following possibilities:
1)If the engine is running rough and smokey exhaust, fuel injector stuck open pouring too much gas in 
2)Possible fuel filter dirty or problem with (?)fuel neck
3)Oxygen sensor, water or fuel dripping on it possibly messing with mixture(cold weather and water unfreezing or lots o'rain
4)EGR sensor(ExhaustGasRecirculation) or valve. Related is the DPFE or differential pressure sensor related to EGR operation
5)Fuel tank pressure sensor
6)water in the spark plug
7)a blown fuse
8)vacuum tube leak near intake manifold (we did find one soft PCV(positive crankcase ventilation) tube near it but don't think this was the cause.)
9)Idle Air Control valve or IAC
10)spark plug or spark plug wires or bad coil or coil pack
11)loose gas cap
After checking the OBD or on-board diagnostic code we got a P0304 which is #4 cylinder misfire, i.e. #10. Changed both the spark plug and the coil and all was well. Finished the last 500 miles without a hitch. In a lot of postings Autozone was talked about as being able to read your OBD codes for free. This turned out NOT to be the case at the one autozone I tried. The employee said they weren't allowed to read them in California. Not sure how wide spread this is but you supposedly can buy one on ebay for approx $45. I think the coil was the prob, the spark plug looked ok but the coils are advertised to 100k miles, 77k was close. I would recommend calling autozone or other parts stores or garages to see if they will read the code for free. The coil and plug were about 100 bucks plus an hour of labor and change for $184 total. Add in the 116 hotel bill and I got out of it pretty good. I hope this info helps someone else out, I've now read too many &quot;check engine&quot; light horror stories. BTW Bob's Auto Service in Elk Grove, CA did a great job, they specialize w/Ford. 
>>ntwperformance|||Followup-question||| as a mechanic / shop owner  i would have to advise not to take it to the zone for diagnostic if you you do ask the person what kind of training he has just reading codes can be very misleading you can spend alot of unnecesary money.and i always read codes for free.have a code email me i will send you all the info i have . 
>>4beatg8|||Answer||| My 96 ford Econline van did a similar thing.  Light came on and we took to Autozone.  Code was PO 401, EGR flow insuffient.  Found out gas cap was loose, tightened it and reset the computer.  Light stayed out for a little while and then came back on steady.  Apparently there is another problem.

>>jonmck|||Original question||| Hi - I have a 1997 Mercury Mountaineer and it has a F57F-18C830-DC CD changer in it.  It will accept the magazine and try to pull and play a CD....but it won't play.  Almost sounds like it just isn't turning the CD or maybe that the mechanism that brings the CD up to the laser gets stuck???  Any ideas?  Think this is fixable?
It will eject the magazine just fine as well.  Once the changer tries to play a cd (after it has pulled it from the magazine).....and tries about 3-4 times....it will say CD E1 on the radio display.  Then I have to eject the magazine.
Thanks again!

However, the motor gets a strain and then it puts the CD back in the magazine.....pulls it back out.....tries to go down to play it....it can't....so it puts it back in the magazine.

>>>Title||| sohc or dohc and cc
>>wrxfreak123|||Original question||| i was wondering which one is better for like hp. i see 1000 hp vipers and they are sohc heads. ok does that mean that the engine breathes better with sohc then dohc. andother question i read about companys porting out heads for like the 302 and the old muscle cars and they use like 100cc. what does the cc mean? and also can anyone tell what kind of heads have higher hp ratings shoc or dohc. can you take like a block thats set up for sohc and convert to dohc? i would guess the pistons would have to be custom made. can that be done? if this sounds stupidly worded im sorry. i know its to many questions and any help would be awsome thanks 
>>MagicRat</span>|||Followup-question||| CC = cubic centimeter, which is a measurement of volume. 
In the case you stated, the combustion chamber volume was being measured. The smaller the chamber, the higher the compression will be. In order to build an engine well, you should measure the combustion chamber volume to determine what type of pistons are required (pop-up, flat top or dished) to achieve a specific compression ratio. 
sohc= single overhead camshaft. 
This type of engine places the cam in the cylinder head and eliminates the pushrods. This means the valve train has less reciprocating mass allowing the engine to rev higher and produce more power before the valves float. 
dohc = double overhead camshaft. 
This does the same as sohc, but in this case the intake valves and the exhaust valves each have their own camshafts. This eliminates the valve rocker arms often found in a sohc engine, which makes the valve train even lighter and higher revving. Also, the valves can be placed at a more advantageous angle for even more power. 
To summerise, pushrod engines are the cheapest and most compact design, but have the least power. 
dohc engines are the most expensive and bulkiest, but produce the most power. 
sohc engines are in between. 
Finally, these points are very general, and there are lots of exceptions to these points, but you get the idea,

>>>Title||| HP / Mileage on a 390 ('63)
>>Dr. Pimento|||Original question||| I've got a '63 Galaxie with what they say is an original 390 in it - I'm wondering - What's the average HP and MPG I can expect out of something that size?
As an alternative (to rebuilding the 390), I have a 302 (1975) that's ready to go.
For comparison purposes, what's the HP/MPG I could expect from the 302?
In addition.. I know the 90 is a big-block, while the 02 is short - what sort of conversions (etc) would I need to link everything up..? 
>>MagicRat</span>|||Answer||| Don't bother with the swap. The '75 engine is an inefficient low compression 135 hp gas hog. Your mileage won't improve much, it will just be a lot slower. Also it would not bolt up to the existing trans, and the engine mounts would be a bit tricky. 
That swap would obliterate the value of your Galaxie, too.
Your car should get 15-18 mpg on the highway. The engine has 250 gross hp, worth about 200 hp in the modern 'net' rating.
If your mileage sucks, pay attention to a proper tune up. Set up the points, timing and dwell properly. Use solid copper core plug wires (intended for an industrial engine) no the modern carbon core wires. 
Better yet, get an electronic ignition conversion kit. 
Also, the 4bbl carbs get better mileage than the 2bbl, if you drive modestly.

>>Mr3GTP|||Followup-question||| If my math is correct, that's 700 lbs of cargo. You could start with stiffer coils, they should be available. I don't think the rubber 'spring helper' devices they sell at autozone would cut it, but that's just me, Mister Overkill. Tires with a higher weight rating (load range) would be a good idea as well. Keep in mind that you are still overloading the brakes, bearings, and the other parts of the suspension (arms, bushings, spindles) so you're still risking a failure. I'd pack the bearings in a good moly-based grease, and install premium brake pads &amp; shoes, like the 'Carbon Metallic' type I have on my '88 Tempo. Stops me better than the 4-wheel discs on my '01 GTP (no kidding), best safety investment I've ever made. If you think good brakes are expensive, consider this; What would a crash cost, especially an &quot;at-fault-because--you-couldn't-stop&quot; type of crash where someone was injured or killed.
Steve

The towing specs on my Topaz is 1,000lbs and your is probably the same.

Quote:
>>UnexplodedCow|||Answer||| I don't know the Taurus gas tanks first hand, but I do know the Tempo and Escort ones, and both of those just have a hose that connects to the top of the gas tank so pressue is always equal with the atmosphere. So, at least in those cars, the fuel pump just pumps fuel from the tank, and any expansion pressure/negative pressure is relieved by the breather tube.
   But, on the original note, I doubt it's the fuel pump. If your engine light came on, and it started running rough even with a full tank, I'd say get the engine checked.

&quot;Ford FPV F6 Tornado
05-05-2005
Powered by a turbo-charged, intercooled, twin overhead cam 4-litre engine,the F6 Tornado unleashes 550Nm of torque. The 18&quot; pewter accent alloy wheels, FPV Performance brakes and pewter accents signal the arrival of a very special ute. The F6 Tornado comes standard with an FPV soft tonneau cover and the option of an alloy sports bar. Also available is an optional hard tonneau with FPV rear spoiler. While the unique F6 grille design proudly displays the purposeful turbo intercooler. Inside, the F6 Tornado Supercab features contoured F6 Sports seats - driver's 4-way electrically adjustable, an interior command centre featuring LCD screen, Prestige 6 stack CD system, plus all-new FPV Sports gauges for turbo boost and oil pressure. The F6 Tornado. Special delivery. 
The all-new F6 270. A 4-litre turbo-charged, intercooled, 24-valve double overhead cam six. The highest torque output of any production six ever built in Australia and one of the most powerful in the world. Through partnership with Prodrive and their mastery of turbo technology across F1 and World Rally, the development of our high performance turbo-charged FPV will change performance cars forever. We created a new engine with dramatically improved cooling and induction. The 50% larger air-to-air intercooler and dual air intake system significantly reduces intake pressure into the turbo's compressor - allowing it to work more efficiently...and effectively.
The result. A fully engineered performance-driven power generator. Armed with double overhead camshafts and 4-valve aluminum cylinder heads, the F6 270 produces its maximum power of 270kW at 5250 rpm. However, the real story is torque. All 550Nm on tap from just 2000 rpm and remaining constant all the way through to 4250 rpm. 
At time of launch, the highest torque output of any production engine ever built in Australia. Even more staggering is the engine's ability to produce 80% of its maximum torque at 1500 rpm and over 98% at 1750 rpm. Total Performance meets the turbo.
F6 270 manual transmission. Part of what makes the F6 Typhoon really special is the T56 6-speed close-ratio manual transmission. This is a technologically advanced new gearbox that puts absolute power in the palm of your hand. The ratios are spaced for maximum performance, minimum fuss. It features the renowned AP Racing clutch - designed to handle the tremendous force of 550Nm of torque - and there's a new FPV shift alert that tells you when to change for optimum upshifts.
Confidence Inc. The power to stop is just as important as the power to go. The ability to wipe off speed cleanly without affecting the vehicle's overall balance. FPV engineers developed a 4-channel anti-lock braking system with electronic brakeforce distribution and two brake packages that will stop you in your tracks. 
Performance brakes up front, large 325 by 32mm grooved and pillar-vented rotors with twin-piston calipers. On the rear, 303 by 16mm grooved and pillar-vented rotors with single piston calipers. Brake lines designed to resist expansion under extreme conditions and high-performance fade-resistant pads that keep on biting. FPV Performance brakes are standard on GT, Pursuit, F6 Typhoon and F6 Tornado.
Brembos. Our premium brake. The brand of choice for Formula 1, Ferrari, Porsche, AMG and CART teams. Up front, massive 355 by 32mm cross-drilled front rotors, fitted with 4-piston calipers finished in classic Brembo red. On the rear, 330 by 28mm cross-drilled rotors, fitted with 4-piston calipers also finished in red. Brembo brakes also feature race-inspired stainless steel braided hoses for added longevity and superior pedal effort. Brembo. Considered one of the best brake packages in the world. Standard on GT-P and optional on all other models. Another example of FPV's commitment to Total Performance.
At FPV, we believe that safety is a major part of Total Performance. As such, all FPVs are monitored by Ford's advanced intelligent safety system. This Ford-designed high-tech software activates appropriate responses to potentially harmful road, traffic and driver situations. 
The system co-ordinates the release and synchronisation of dual-stage airbags, side airbags (sedans only) and front seat belt pre-tensioners to maximise driver and passenger protection in the event of a mishap. FPV's stringent safety measures also include superior braking and handling together with ABS and traction control (sedan only). The safest car, of course, is the car that prevents an accident in the first place.

>>Whitewolf1970|||Original question||| Okay...after the master cylinder was repaired and the breather valve was tighten.  Usually, I forgot to ask a question about the starter.  Why does the starter get killed almost every 4 months sometimes 6 months, sometimes 3 months?   The starter we bought is brand-new more expensive than the rebuilt starter.  We replaced the starter solenoid, but doesn't make sense that the starter just DIED like that.  What is going on???   Is it the cable from the starter solenoid (fender area) to the starter??    It's embarrassed.  Nothing happened this morning when going to DMV, but I came home and rest for a while.  Then I drove to the middle school to pick up my daughter.  I parked there in the street, waiting and waiting for her, engine off.  Once she jumped in, I started the car and the car won't start.  Then tried changing the starter solenoid which cost me $9 from Autozone (luckily, it's near her school and near where I parked the car).   I called AAA and has it towed to my home.    Thanks. 
>>Mr3GTP|||Answer||| Check the cable that goes from the solenoid to the starter. It may have a break in it causing an intermittent power loss. 
What I've found, though is that a bad ground can have you pulling your hair out. So, check every ground, including the ones on the r/s strut tower, the ones just in front of the battery, the main battery ground cable's connection to the engine, and even the one atop the core support just above the right end of the radiator. I hope this helps you; electrical problems can drive you crazy-been there, done that! 
>>Whitewolf1970|||Followup-question||| Okay, thanks  .  I will tell my children's dad to check the whole thing.  I have been telling him to get rid of the Tempo because it has some problems since he bought it from the Cars101 dealer.  It has since closed its business.  First the axle, we did not know it was involved in an accident prior to our buying it from the dealer.  The SunRise auto center told me, showed me, and asked if we were in any accident: none.  But once I found out, I got the dealer to cough up the truth if that car was in an accident.  He admitted.  I was furious.  Then the starter acting up sometimes..then the lighting wires went haywires but fixed immediately.  The A/C unit is still going crazy..so I told my kids' dad to sell it.  He said he loves his car. The engine was replaced by the Cars101 because of the accident. &lt;sigh&gt;  I told my children's dad the reason I didn't like it because it drives me crazy and because I kept missing classes from college all due to the starter and the radiator heating up (that radiator's area has been fixed... I didn't pay, he paid.)

>>Whitewolf1970|||Followup-question||| Cool.  That's a lot of vehicles.  It sounds like you're rebuilding from the scratch until it'll be like-new or in excellent condition.  I love it when some like to dig in and pull 'em apart and put 'em together.   
>>OverBoardProject|||Answer||| Keep the poor old Tempo. Those cars are the one of the best cars that Ford made in recent years.
Especially the old 85 - 86 diesel's.
Only the new TDI V.W's even compare 
>>Mr3GTP|||Followup-question||| Hey Overload, I know this is off-topic, buuut,
 I looked at your pics, that Topaz is beautiful!! If that's any indication of your work, those other projects will be worth the wait! 
And I agree about the Tempo/Topaz being good, one of the most durable I've seen in ages. Most run around with little or no care, many are abused &amp; neglected. They've been out of production for over 10 years, and still can be seen everywhere! In fact, most of the ones I see are older, '2nd-gen' cars built from '88 through '91. My '88 LX 4-door 5-speed is tighter &amp; more solid than my '01 GTP, believe it or not.
I don't know if you're familiar with , but it is a goldmine of info about these cars, and is populated by many who love these cars too. The 'Tech Center', is full of useful info. You can find data on year-by-year model changes, engine availability, options, even rare cars like the '92 GLS, XR5, and LTS models. Also, a great forum full of helpful people, with categories for most any need. Check it out if you get the chance, good people! 
>>OverBoardProject|||Answer||| Thank you for the complement Mr3GTP
I just love this car. And it treats me so good.
I hate to say it, but I had to abuse it for 1 1/2 years while recovering form a boating accident.   I couldn't even change the oil myself. And since I couldn't work and the insurance company was trying to starve me my poor car couldn't get any of the attention that it deserved..
During that time I had to put on over 50,000km to the doctors alone.
You bet that I treated my car to a good tune up and everything as soon as I was able to!
Thanks for the link, and everything. 
>>>Title||| Warning to Tempo owners
>>dxrflyboy|||Original question||| Thanks to a problem I was unaware of, my 1992 4cyl Tempo is done delivering papers.  The engine lost oil pressure while I was driving on the highway.  The crankcase was full.  Since a tow would cost as much as I paid for the car and I didn't have time to wait, I limped it home.  The oil pressure came back several miles later, but by then it was too late.  The engine now knocks and has lost compression.  Unfortunately for me, I've only been working at a Ford dealer for a few years and am not familiar with the idiosyncracies of older Fords.  My service manager came back from vacation this week and I told him what happened to my car.  He told me that Tempos (4cyl) were notorious for the oil pump pickups plugging up with sludge.  Had I known this, I would have changed my oil more frequently and flushed the engine regularly to prevent this from happening.  Fortunately, this car is a cheap beater and I bought another Tempo from a coworker, so the parts I put into this one can be used on the new car.  But I want other 4cyl Tempo owners to be aware of this problem so you can prevent it from happening to your car. 
>>wsh6b@yahoo.com|||Answer||| Thanks For The Tip. I Have Two 92 Mod Tempos. Got Both Used From Friends. I Thing I'll Go Change My Oil Now. 
>>Markgase2000|||Followup-question||| I heard alot about this before and since i bought my 93 tempo gl I use a liter of Lucas Heavy Duty Oil Stabilizer with my oil changes and it made the compression even and made the valves and cylinders a bit quieter.
 I am having trouble with my front springs , there strong as they can be but they are too long so its like driving a spring board. I need to know what to do about the springs before I replace my struts. 
>>dxrflyboy|||Answer||| If your struts are worn out the car will be bouncy.  My '92 was, with 217K on it.  My &quot;new&quot; '94 is much more stable at 145K, except for the back, since the LR is blown.  I'll be swapping the backs from my '92 before I scrap it, along with a bunch of other parts.  BTW, if anyone needs any parts, let me know, and soon, because the car has to go. 
>>UnexplodedCow|||Answer||| I never had a single problem with my oil pickup tube plugging, and the original owner told me that they had only changed the oil every 30k, and no, that is not a typo. They kept adding oil. I was cleaning sludge out of the oil pan for a while, but I never had bad pressure. My gauge read around 60-65 psi all the time. It was an aftermarket mechanical gauge I put in. 
>>Doc_Ratchet|||Followup-question||| I had an 88 2.3L 2WD 2-dr 5-spd that i went about 20k (20,000) miles between oil changes once by accident of shear laziness. The whole time I did this, I think I had to dump one whole quart in her. When I finally did the oil change, I flushed the motor using #2 Deisel (don't attemp this unless you know exactly how to do it.) and it cleaned her right up. I finished the change by using a 50/50 synthetic blend. This car was my daily runner as well my play around and occasional racer (won some lost some). I bought it in June 2003 for $1500. It got hit in a parking lot and only sufferred cosmetic damge, but the other person's insurance still wrote it off as totalled and cut me a check for $1560. Woulda been $1600 if I hadn't kept the car, but as I said, the damage was only cosmetic. Without fixing the cosmetic damage, I sold her in February to a co-worker for $1500. For those of you keeping score, that's $3060 I made off the car. My co-worker hasn't had to drop a dime into her yet, and he races her almost as much as I used to. This car was the first Ford I didn't have problems with, and was enough to get me to look at other Fords when I decided to go new car shopping. I now have three Fords, all of which I'm more or less having a blast with. All three of them have 4-cyl engines. None have any problems with any oil, oil pumps, or anything. And the 2.3L in my Ranger is the exact same motor as the one that was in my Tempo. So ya lost me when you say it's a universal problem amongst the Ford 4 bangers. 
>>dxrflyboy|||Followup-question||| I think you misread my original post.  I was referring to the 2.3L HSC 4-cylinder engine in the Tempo/Topaz.  The post doesn't apply to any other Ford engines.  Also, the Ranger's 2.3L OHC engine has nothing in common with the pushrod engine in the Tempo/Topaz except for its displacement.  I'm also glad that you haven't had the same problem I did, but the point of my post was only to emphasize the importance of proper maintenance, which I believe is critical for any engine.

>>Jerry near St. Lou|||Followup-question||| Does the pinging sound go away at the same time that the oil pressure light goes off? If so chances are that the oil in the engine is draining back into the block. This is usually due to a cheap or defective oil filter. Try replacing it with a quality filter like a Wix. I don't think much of Fram filters. It's probably more of a light knock than a true ping.
Which engine light? If it's the oil light, well....  Any other light is probably just a coincidence and you have some other problem.

We don't want to waste money on fixing the brakes.   Okay, when I was driving around.  Once come to a stop, I was waiting for the green light but the pressure were getting down on the gas pedal.  The more I pressed the gas pedal, the more it kept on going down and make the car moves forward.  We have to use the neutral gear until the green light is on before we shift the gear to &quot;D&quot; drive.  Any idea what is going on with the brakes??   The lights didnt' show up for any brake problem.  Thanks. 
>>Doc_Ratchet|||Answer||| Sounds like the breather valve is loose. Make sure your master cylinder is full, then bleed the brakes and tighten everything back up properly, problem should go away. If this doesn't work, trace all the brake lines and make sure you don't have a leak or kink in any of the lines. 
>>Whitewolf1970|||Answer||| Okay, thanks.  We took his car to the tire shop and like you said, the mechanic found the problem there.  But my kids' dad said he'll have to save some bucks and bring it in, in two weeks or next week. It will not be expensive than he paid earlier ago.  He just paid over $400 for the arm control, and some other parts.

So Tempo owners, cast your vote now if you would like to see your very own forum and maybe we can get the moderators and administrators to do something about it!
  
>>Mr3GTP|||Answer||| Doc,
 I agree, as a longtime Tempo/Topaz owner, there is a lot of activity from owners of these under-appreciated little cars. 
 Not to pull traffic away from AF, but  (home of the Tempo-Topaz Car Club of North America) is a great resource for owners &amp; enthusiasts of these cars. Year-by-year technical info, modifications, downloads, and a forum filled with some of the best people out there! Any kind of help you need can likely be found there, an incredible knowledge base. I've been a member since '02. 
Good bunch of people, check it out...
Oh, and my 'toy' is an '88 Tempo LX 5-speed sedan. With the help of an Eaton M45 Supercharger, front mounted I/C, and a few other goodies(MSD BTM, Kirban FMU, a header made by a club member), I hope to easily smoke my own Grand Prix GTP (14.39@95.37mph) later this summer

 As for my 'project', I'm making no appearance mods at all, so this car will be a real 'stealth bomber', whether I'm at the stop light or the 'tree.
The blower &amp; intercooler are mounted, and most of the plumbing is built. The howl of that Eaton is like a song! Best part is, this particular Eaton came off a Mercedes, so it has an electric clutch. I can kill the telltale 'whine' until the last minute, (hehe) and keep heat from building up while cruising.

>>tusukious|||Followup-question||| this is in reference of some remarks you made in nov of 03. yes way back then. anyway you said you work for ford and you raced alot of 5.0's and beat them. personaly i think your full of shit. your little v6 would never touch the power that a 5.0 makes. not unless you have a stock 8lb charger, which you dont. how do i know....i have a 93 gt hatchback, 03 mach1, 99 gt, 02 grand prix with and 8lb eaton charger, and a 94 f-250.....oops sorry.lol. anyways my grand prix beats my 93 gt by.6 in the 60ft time because of the charger.also 0.2 in the 8th. but the gt pulls out and beats my grand prix by 3 tenths, and you have less power than my grand prix, also working for ford you should know that it would be rediculous for your little pontiac v6 would come anywhere close to even keeping up with a newer gt. ive gotten a 13.8 out of my 99 stock.
  next your going to be saying that you can beat mach1's and cobra's. so before you do that i want to say that ford claims 305hp with the mach's but ive seen 324 on a dyno with mine. everywhere you look you will see that they run a 13.5 or.6 in a 1/4 but i got a 13.2 out of mine on a cold day. now its running 11.42's on motor, which is nothing compared to my 93 which is now running 9.80's on motor. so you see there's no way in hell your stock grand am will beat ANY gt. also you probably think your mr. big shit rolling around with a v6 with 2 1/2 exhaust, but i hope you know since you dont have a charger that your losing power due to backpressure.. might want to have that looked at.

>>>Title||| pls help dizzy mare with &quot;dead&quot; expedition
>>jsnca03|||Original question||| I have a 1999 Expedition (EB) that died on me as I approached a traffic light yesterday.  I am desperate for advice.  We have just spent $2,500 replacing the air suspension bags and pumps about a month ago (although the garage had to do it twice because of the Ford parts!)  About 10 days ago my battery &quot;died&quot;.  My neighbour jumped started it for me and hubby &quot;meant&quot; to get a new one.  The following day we couldn't even jump it.  The AAA guy came out and said that it was just our secondary alarm system, pushed a little button under the dash, and voila!  Hubby, again, meant to get a new battery.  For the past 3-4 days OCCASIONALLY, maybe once a day, the oil light lit up for a few seconds.  Hubby, again, meant to get a new battery and put some oil in.  This brings me to yesterday.  Had the car towed after waiting 1.5 hours at the traffic light waiting for AAA with two kind constables helping to entertain a 1 year old and 3 year old.  The same garage called me later to say that they had put the car up and drained the oil.  (This is where the dizzy mare part comes in!)  They said that there was less that half a ? of which my car should have 7? and he believed the engine seized because there was no oil.  I told him about the OCCASIONAL light that came up and couldn't believe that if it was that low that the light would not have stayed on.  Anyway, asked him if he had checked the battery and the secondary alarm system.  He kind of said &quot;duh, what&quot;.  I explained what the tow guy had done to which he later called me back and said they had put a new battery in and pushed the button and it was &quot;engaging&quot; but that the engine was not turning over.  He said the put a &quot;crank&quot; on the engine and could not even turn it it was so seized.  
I still believe that this has something to do with the secondary alarm system but don't know what to do.  He says we should either put a new engine in or sell it for about $100 scrap.  Pretty funny as we just gave them all that money a month ago to do the suspension with new parts. 
Does anyone recognize this type of thing?  The car reacted in exactly the same way as before, and then it had worked.  Am I missing a trick?  Please help if you can.  I would really appreciate it. 
>>MagicRat</span>|||Answer||| It is possible that the bad battery problem is not related to the low oil problem. 
Yes, low oil can seize an engine over time. It will not illuminate the light all the time because the oil level in the engine moves around a bit periodically exposing and covering up the oil pump pick up tube. This causes the oil pressure to drop occasionally. Unfortunately the damage is cumulative. 
IMHO take the truck to another mechanic for a second opinion. Even if you must pay for a tow, get it out of there. Your mechanic is can potentially make a lot of money from the seized engine diagnosis, especially if he is wrong or lying to you. 
Your mechanic is definitly lying to you about scrapping it. Even with a seized engine, your truck is still worth $5000-10,000. (NOT $100)
Good luck. 
>>dreymeek|||Answer||| You better quit relying on hubby for your car repairs. It's obvious your mechanic isn't the brightest bulb on the block. Ditto on getting it out of that shop and into another one. After the '' $100 for scrap'' comment, get away from him FAST!

First i changed the plug wires because they were split and the plugs,the car started many times,and then after i took it for a test drive for about one mile then stalled and it wouldn't start again, after several tries,i started to check my snugnesh of the wires i realized the distributor is loose, cause somebody else she told me worked on that disributor.
Please tell me the steps involved to tighten that distributor.

>>Mayflower|||Original question||| We just bought this car and everything seemed to be working fine. The fuse to the tail lights, parking lights, licences plates light, headlight on buzzer and chimes keeps blowing out. It's the number 4 fuse.  Also dash lights and shifter light aren't working either. Might be number 13 fuse?  We need these working, as it's dangerous on the road without them. The brake lights work and the backup ones do too. The turn signals had stopped working too. We replaced the silver canister and they seem to be working again. Can you help us or let us know what may be happening here? Thanks so much. 
>>UnexplodedCow|||Answer||| I'd check your light switch first. I had one that blew my fuses, so I replaced it and all was good. Also check your ignition switch. Not the lock cylinder, but the switch on the column. They tend to wear out, and I had problems in my old tempo. My turn signals wouldn't work, and sometimes the radio cut out until I replaced the switch. 
>>mustangmike351c|||Answer||| see if there is a penny or something in your cigaret lighter if not you have a short to ground. you can check this by taking the tail light out, use a dmm and see if there is continuity from the positive to the body ground

Also I cant tell if its truly the serpintine belt making the squeels. I guess Ill need someones ears cus mine are toast from the loud air compressor at work. 
>>dxrflyboy|||Answer||| If the belt squeals even after you replace it, replace the tensioner.  Unless a component is seizing up, the tensioner isn't holding the belt tight enough.

>>>Title||| 460 motor problem
>>aigpd|||Original question||| New to this forum. Need some help with an engine problem. Performed a compression test and all my cylinders were all 125-130 except for no. 5 and it measured 75. I run the engine for a few minutes to circulate the oil and rechecked no. 5 and now it read 25 on the tester. I assume a head gasket problem. No oil in coolant or coolant in oil. Thinking that when running that the fuel is washing the cylinder hence the additional loss of compression. Any thoughts on this? Thanks in advance for the help. 
>>MagicRat</span>|||Followup-question||| Oil does not seal a cylinder when running. I suspect that thermal expansion after its warmed up is causing either the rings or valves not to seal properly, which is why the pressure decreaes when warm.
Try pouring a bit of oil down into #5. turn it over a few revolutions and try another test. If the compression increases a lot, your rings are bad. If there is no change, its a valve or gasket. 
Also try a leak down test. This is where you use an air line adaptor screwedinto the spark plug hole. Rotate the engine to TDC on #5 with both valves closed. Pressurize the cylinder with 100 psi of air or so and listen carefully. 
Bad rings will allow air to leak into the crankcase and you can hear it run out the crankcase breather hose. A bad intake valve will blow air through the carb. Often a bad gasket will produce air bubbles through the coolant, escaping through the rad. 
If you can hear air hissing out but can't find the leak, its probably a bad exhaust valve.
Finally, when its running, try removing the oil filler cap and have someone step on the gas while holding it with the brake in gear. Bad rings will send blow by shooting out the oil filler. 
A bad intake valve will produce a backfire through the carb, or make it run poorly. A blown head gasket will blow all the coolant out the radiator. But if it runs okay without any of these symptoms, its probably a leaking exhaust valve.

If you unbolt the rear trans. mount bracket from under the car, you might be able to rock the engine enough to get better access to the back manifold.  If you're lucky, the manifold may not have to come off at all.  You may be able to reach the flange bolts once you rock the engine back a little and get the pipe off.  Also, soak the flange bolts with penetrating oil.  The longer they soak (overnight, 24 hours, etc.) the easier they will come off.  I'll also check the Tempo shop manual in case there is a procedure for removal.

>>Juantontiki|||Original question||| i use my tempo for my newspaper route and sometimes when im accelerating from a stop, the gas pedal seems harder to push and the car doesnt shift until about 30mph. but thats only if i dont punch the gas when it starts doing it. ive learned if i punch the gas down when it starts to get hard to push, it breaks free and shifts normaly. i took it to a mechanic and he said a bushing was missing or something. he said he wasnt sure if that would cause it or not. he said he'd order me one and then call me, but its been over a week and no call. does anyone here think a simple thing like that would cause my problem? or is it a transmission problem? It doesnt do it all the time. only about 4-5 times on my route, and my route takes about an hour and a half to do. Ive also noticed recently that it does the same thing when i go in reverse, only the pedal is even harder to push. ive changed my tranny fluid and filter and it made no difference. thanks. 
>>dxrflyboy|||Followup-question||| Am I looking in the mirror or something??  Delivering newspapers in a Tempo??  Sticky throttle??  Oh yeah, mine's a '92.  Actually, I've noticed mine does it all the time in reverse, then after I shift into drive, I have to snap the throttle once to &quot;free it up&quot;.  The problem is definitely the transmission throttle valve, although I don't know exactly why it happens.  It also does it when I shift into L1 then back into drive.  I've put 5K on the car delivering newspapers and nothing has broken yet (knock on wood).  Something is causing the throttle valve to stick when the low/reverse clutch or band is engaged.  My car is a $100 beater with over 200K on it, so I just put up with it.  A transmission flush might help with the sticking valve, but I have a feeling there is a fluid pressure leak into the throttle valve causing the resistance.  For me, it just isn't worth fixing.

>>dxrflyboy|||Followup-question||| PS:  This Ford dealer tech, who &quot;don't have a clue&quot;, went ahead and searched for a TSB regarding this problem.  Lo and behold, one does exist, and the problem &quot;is related to the transaxle TV plunger position at idle,&quot; according to TSB #95-1-15.  If you want to correct this problem, have your Ford dealer refer to this TSB and make necessary repairs.  If you want to do it yourself and your local dealer is nice enough, you may be able to obtain a copy of the TSB and follow it yourself. 
>>dxrflyboy|||Followup-question||| I just did a little redneck engineering on mine, since the above mentioned TSB led me to another TSB that recommended replacing the valve body and possibly rebuilding the tranny (not an option on my $100 beater!)  I disconnected the throttle rod at the TV lever and turned the base around so that the return spring hole was in front instead of behind the rod.  I then made a bracket for the spring out of perforated steel strap so the spring could be attached in the forward position.  This eliminated the bind, since the spring no longer pulls the TV lever all the way to the idle position.  It took some tweaking to position the spring in such a way that the trans. didn't delay the shifts too much.  Right now, it upshifts a little late under light throttle (1-2 at 15-20 mph, 2-3 at 25-30 mph, slightly higher speeds with a cold engine) and the coastdown 3-2 shift is a little abrupt.  But I can live with that.  At least I'm not overstressing all the linkages anymore.  This also eliminated a &quot;locking&quot; problem my trans. had in reverse.  It no longer seems to be stuck between forward and reverse and requires less throttle to back up.  This also intensified the problem of the broken motor mount, which caused the trans. to rotate and slam into the steering rack every time I backed up.  This required redneck repair number 2 - I ran a chain from the mount bracket to the chassis bracket to hold the motor back in reverse!

>>zedkoman|||Original question||| i have a problem similar to beigecar. my tempo has about 50 thousand miles on, its an automatic transmission. this is my first car  while i am braked at an intersection, the car stalls. what i do to stop is to get into neutral or park and push the gas lightly to prevent stalling. i checked all the fluids, i looked for a vacuum leak, and everything seem ok.. but the problem persists. another thing is that when i accelerate the car it barely budges and makes these heaving noises under the hood, after the speedometer reaches 30 does it actually seem to work at the speed, but my foot has to be completely pushing the gas pedal all the way to the ground to get there. this is just to start. the power windows wont budge on the driver's side and behind on the right. i live in an area where having a car is a necessity, not a choice, so i am trying to look up some literature for car repair novices on the net, but all that i find are guides that are trying to sell stuff. help is welcome. 
>>pcv|||Followup-question||| Unless we look at the car, it is hard to diagnose the problem. However, all we can do is suggest certain remedies that might help. In your case, I'd check the tranny fluid level. Make sure it is full. The lack of power could also be due to a plugged catalytic convertor. How's the tune up?. The coil tower on these vehicles are notorious for corrosion. Check it out. 
>>Dan_in_WA|||Followup-question||| The first thing to do is read any codes the computer has stored.  That will get you started off in the right direction.

>>>Title||| 1986 ford tempo (no spark)-sudden loss of power
>>Tony&amp;Delfina|||Original question||| We have a 1986 Ford Tempo with 320,000km on it with a carburetor (not fuel injected). No doubt it has been reliable until now. During the last month we have been experiencing a sudden loss of power (no spark). We always had the usual problem with it overfueling (stalling) at stoplights and such, but this is new. We have replaced the ignition coil, spark plug wires and finally the ignition switch. The spark plugs show a good clean spark when the car is running. The car battery is 3 years old and appears to be showing no problems. After the ignition switch replacement we thought we had it solved. For one week during a recent cold snap of weather no problem surfaced. As soon as warmer weather arrived the problem returned. We thought it might be the TFI module but our car has the ignition control module on the firewall. Is it possible that we have both a TFI (remote, as we cannot find it on the distributor) and an ignition control module? Where would a remote TFI be located with this vehicle, if we have one?
If we don't, is the solution to replace the ignition control module on the firewall or should we look somewhere else? 
>>BigCheech|||Answer||| no TFI on a 86 with a carb:smoker2: 
>>daytonaes93|||Answer||| not posative if that car has one but check the cam sensor and the crank sensor

>>BurlyBob|||Original question||| Both of the rear wheel bearings just went out of our 1989 all-wheel-drive Tempo. It just seems strange that they would both go at the same time. I suppose that the bearings are different than a normal front-drive Tempo. I wonder what this is going to cost? 
>>UnexplodedCow|||Followup-question||| If they're anything like the front bearings, they'll be about 30 bucks apiece, and just have a good puller to pull the old bearing out, and push the new one in. It's really a simple process. If the rear bearings are anything like a fwd tempo, then just take the drum off, and the bearings and races should be pressed into it. Press them out, press in new bearing races, new bearings, and you're ready to go. Also, did you check for bearing wobble? They could just be loose.

>>2thdr2b|||Answer||| I have a 1992 Ford Tempo.  I replaced the front calipers and rear cylinders including new pads and shoes.  I also replaced the master cylinder.  I am now trying to bleed the brakes and only one circuit is working.  I am able to bleed the brakes on the front right and rear left but can't get anything to happen on the other circuit.  It seems like there is too much pressure on the pedal and I can't push the pedal far enough to activate the secondary piston in the master cylinder.  The lines are clear as I am able to blow air through them.  There are no leaks in the system.  Any help on getting the system bled so all 4 brakes work would be helpful. 
>>UnexplodedCow|||Original question||| First off, bleed the rear brakes first....and do you know how to bleed the rear ones? I know it's a dumb question, but it's still relevant.

I explained to them that I had purchased the vehicle a couple of months ago &amp; the rear windshield motor was not working they said well we have some time 2 check it right now so I left it there while I went shopping.
Came back abou 2hours later &amp; they told me my waranty covers it but there is a deductible of $100.00 dollars &amp; that the new motor with labor of install would be $140.00 all together.
I told them lets set up an appiontment. (they told me the motor was burnt out &amp; I beleived them.)

>>>Title||| headlamp blurring problem
>>kpriv|||Original question||| Hi all.  I have a 88 Thunderbird which developed the foggy headlamp issue.  I found plenty of information on how to resolve the issue using a mothers cleanser and wet sandpaper.  I went out and bought the stuff and proceeded to attempt to fix the problem.
I did the outside and saw about a 5-10% decrease in the fogginess.  I then attempted to remove the lamp(s) and do the inside...  but..
After I removed the inside screws, the casing itself seems to be sealed with the lamp inserted through a half-dollar sized hole in the center.
So, how can I scrub down the inside of the plastic ?  The majority of the cloudiness is clearly inside the casing and I am hesitant to start doing irreversible damage by attempting to 'crack it open'.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks.
Keith P. 
>>twisted_axel|||Answer||| replace the headlamp some of those you can open by seperating the glass from the reflector but most of the timeit's easier to go top a junk yard and get one for a few bucks 
>>goodolboydws|||Answer||| If you haven't solved your cloudy headlight lens problem yet,try WASHING and flushing the inside of the lens. A soft bottle brush can sneak inside, and a garden hose and sprayer will also help, but be prepared to get soaked yourself in the process. Some of the time the insides will only be dirty rather than actually UV damaged as the outside was.

I have a 2dr 67 galaxie 500 with a 390. I just had the original 2v carb and intake swapped for a 4b edlebrock and high pro intake manifold. He re-jetted the carb and tweaked it as good as he could.

Anyways when i get on the gas hard i here a click and there is a delay like im not even on the gas then it reacts and takes off-my problem is that i am going to race it this spring/summer and that delay will kill me-so what might be the problem? Thanks!
-Ben 
>>goodolboydws|||Answer||| lots of possibilities
ambient temperature issues may make the engine run poorly until intake air is warmer, even if carb is jetted properly
the accelerator pump diaphragm has failed
partially plugged jet(s) 
accelerator (pri or sec) pump delivered fuel volume is way too small 
accelerator pump (pri or sec) delivered fuel volume is much too large 
the timing of the accelerator pump stroke is way off
carbs' secondary linkage is hanging up
carb is severely overjetted for the temperature
vacuum leak affecting carb (intake manifold leak a likely source)
engine timing is not set correctly
engine timing affected by vacuum leak
bad gas

I need some assistance with a decision of whether to give a handydown (A '91 Taurus SHO) or to take a 2000 Ford Focus (don't know what type - just it's a coupe), Manual, worth $5800 blue book. The Taurus is worth $1800 or so blue book. The only thing that seems better with the SHO is the high performance engine, which I never have really 'used' as it was a handydown from my mom. It has also had several part replacements and problems with steering but they seem to be fine after repairs. This car was originally supposed to be for my sister (the Focus) for her 16th Birthday but I'm going off to college this fall (they have been looking for one for a while and got an excellent deal, $4500, couldn't pass it up), and while my father says the Taurus is dependable, I beg to differ simply because I don't know about another 4 years at 133,000 miles right now. The body is very good and the interior is fine (the Taurus). I hate making my sister upset, but I feel that I have earned the choice of maybe taking the Focus, especially after never getting in any accidents or tickets. It just seems logical for me to get the newer car, (plus it actually has a little more legroom according to online specs, I'm 6'4&quot;).  My father didn't anticipate getting a newer car, so this is why I'm thinking about this now. What do you guys think? Is the choice obvious?

>>>Title||| OEM Navigation system installation hel[
>>gunkel04|||Original question||| I have installed a oem navigation system out of an 03' Expedition into my 02' E-350, along with the nav unit I have installed a DVD player and ricp out of an 04' Navigator. Everything works as it should except for the nav unit. My problem I believe is in the one wire that feeds the vehicle speed info into the unit. I am unsure where this should be tapped into, I have tried the the LF wheel speed sensor, the rear end speed sensor, and the trans speed sensor, all to no avail. I even tried a abs module out of a navigator, bootlegged it up with as few wires possible, and still, the nav unit does not show me moving. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!!! Thanks... 
>>C-Man|||Followup-question||| gunkel,
Did you get this to work?  I am trying to do a nearly identical project.  I am going from an '03 Expedition to an '04.  Can you tell me what you did to make your's work?
I just bought the head unit and would really like to know what it takes to do this mod, as I have time to back out of the deal.
Thanks... 
>>The ORIG. Dig. Oxy|||Followup-question||| There should be a VSS (Vehicle Speed Sensor) lead that goes into the EEC.  
That's where you're supposed to tap the Speed pulse wire.  
Tapping it on the wheel speed sensor won't work.
I don't know what the lead number that is, but it should be easy enough to find in publications like Helms. 
>>T Prok|||Followup-question||| I too would like to know how you wired the Nav unit.
I have an '03 Expy and I got the Nav unit off of e-bay and I have yet to figure out how to wire it in.  I need the pin out of the unit and the plugs to go into the unit.
I added the OEM DVD unit allready, my expy didn't come with it, I got it off of e-bay $150.00 and did a lot of research to figure out how to wire it in but I did it and the kids love.
Now if I can get a little help with the Nav unit my life will be complete.  
I think the wire you are looking for is the VSS (vehicle speed sensor) wire.
I have seen this on some post about this &quot;I THINK&quot; it is a grey wire with black stripe.  But don't quote me on that.

>>escort0526|||Followup-question||| ...and now for a coherent response.  The Tempo seat belts run on a plastic track that binds up as the casing cracks with age.  This is the likely cause of your problem.  The only way to fix it and make it work as intended from the factory is to replace the track which is about $75.00 each from a salvage yard.  You can, if you like, unplug the motor,it's in the door pillar on sedans and next to the rear seat passengers on two doors. This isn't an official fix, but it will lock them in position and you'll have to operate them manually.  If they're the kind without a release as some tempo's were you'll have to spring for the salvage yard fix to make them legal.

>>drummindrummer|||Original question||| Hi Folks:
I'm trying to pass Cali smog with an 87 Sable 3.0 and the EVR (vacuum regulator) isn't getting it's ground trigger when the r's increase (voltmeter shows 3v constant under all rpm's). Does anyone have an idea what I should check next? Is there another sensor that tells the ECU when this should occur? Thanks very much in advance for your knowledge. Markus 
>>fry628|||Followup-question||| Your dpfe tells the vacuum regulator when to open and is a common thing to go out. Also it's important to know that rpm's do not make the regulator open, engine load does. When the dpfe senses the exhaust gases are rich it tells the regulator to open the egr valve for a cleaner burn 
>>drummindrummer|||Answer||| 
Quote:
>>drummindrummer|||Followup-question||| Okay, I changed out the dpfe then tested the electrical to the EVR under load but still just a constant 3 volts there. I thought it a good idea to do some checking into the wiring for all this stuff and (manually performed, perhaps flawed trace work, without a wiring diagram) discovered this much...
DPFE plug (3 wires - {BRN/GRN} {OR/WHT} {BLK/WHT}):
   *BRN/GRN seems to connect to connector block @ firewall;
   *OR/WHT and BLK/WHT seem to go to and occupy two of the three      
     terminals of the TPS. If my presumption that these go to/from the
     DPFE and the TPS directly is correct, there must be a short
     connecting them. I'm getting zero-ish resistance at the leads while
     both sensors are unplugged.
Is there a kind soul with wiring diagram/knowledge who can tell me if my trace work is good? Sorry for my ignorance, I'm trying to save my fixed/low-inc sister from the wolf of poverty. Thanks very much in advance, Markus 
>>fry628|||Followup-question||| I just realized that you have a nissan while on a ford forum but that still shouldn't have much to do with theory. I don't have a wiring diagram.

>>>Title||| Ford Warranty Denial for Regular Gas Use ?
>>Borpe|||Original question||| My Owner's Manual states that Premium gasoline is required for my Focus SVT. I've been using mid-grade 89. I think this avoids the higher cost of 91 premium, but also avoids the potential power loss of 87 regular. I'm completely happy with the performance of the car on 89. No knock and no hesitation.
I'm told by other Focus SVT owners that use of 89 gasoline invalidates Ford's Warranty. I'm told that use of 89 will lead to engine damage and that Ford tests incoming cars at their dealerships and specifically voids warranty coverage if the gasoline tests at less than 91.
I'm trying to find the truth. Does Ford invalidate the car's warranty if I use 89 mid-grade ?  Articles I've found on the internet seem to agree that use of 89 gas does not invalidate a car's warranty - but I can't find a specific statement from Ford.
Can someone direct me to a website statement by Ford on this issue ? Something definitive by a representative of Ford ?  (I don't need a restatement of the Owners' Manual). 
>>carr17|||Followup-question||| As far as i know if Ford does not say in the owners manual or anywhere else on the car that the warranty would be void, the warranty will not be void. As long as the car doesn't lack in performance or show any signs or detenation(knocks and pings), i would continue using mid grade gasoline. 
>>Borpe|||Answer||| 
Quote:
>>benchtest|||Followup-question||| It would seem logical that any damage caused by fuel would not be under warranty.  Ford has no control over what you put in, or what comes out of the pump.  Proving the damage was caused by the fuel is another matter, but if it's proven, they will likely fight a warranty repair...AS THEY SHOULD.  Your engine is tuned to run on higher octane fuel.  The ECU will monitor the sensors to prevent damgae as best it can, but realize that knocking does damage, and the computer only adjusts for knock AFTER it happens.  Even if it happens only for a second and the computer adjusts, it is not a permanent change in the program.  It will try to move back to the original settings again.  So, the cycle will repeat.  It's comparable to bouncing off the guard-rail to stay on the road.  You can probably avoid any damage by granny-driving the car with low octane fuel.  But, you bought a performance vehicle.  Why would you spend the extra cash to buy it and then throw cheap gas in it?  That's penny-wise and dollar-foolish.  It's your car, so do as you wish, just don't expect warranty to cover a repair if you can't follow the instructions that came with the car.  Would you feel any different if you owned Ford?

>>Borpe|||Followup-question||| [quote=Madcat455]Actually... He hit the nail right on the head.
I don't want to get into a long discussion about ECUs. I'm well aware of how spark control operates. It's not how either of you describe it - as a continual resetting to dangerously advanced settings. These issues with this particular engine revolver around the relatively mild 10.2:1 CR and the modern combustion chamber design with short fuel flamefronts which tend to mitigate detonation. I'm aware of the real technical issues - not what some instant experts read in a comic book. Modern engines tend to be well-controlled and - in most cases, unless they are supercharged - do not have the sloppy variability and extreme CRs for which older designs alsolutely required premium octane. Most engines for which premium is &quot;recommended&quot; do just fine of regular or mid-grade. See for example the discussion in . Even Porsche engines are designed to be safe on regular - even though they lose a small percentage of power . I'm asking for expert advice from people who actually know Ford's policy. I don't need any more shadetree mechanic commentary.
Sorry to be so blunt. I've rather tired of having to explain this to people who aren't up on the issue. 
>>yotermanic|||Followup-question||| I'm a Ford Technician with a SVT specialty, so I know Ford's policies and tests for warranty eligbility and I also know their policies on what is and is not covered as well as what engine strategy is for inferior fuel.  The short answer to your question is: yes.  Using any fuel, or additive that is not recommended by Ford Motor Company will void your manufacturer's warranty.  To them, it's the same as if you put gas in a diesel motor.  We recommend what to use, what the vehicle is designed for, and if you don't use it and it causes a problem, it's your own deal.  The longer answer is, who the hell will know?  I've been in a dealership since I was eighteen and still have never even heard of Ford Motor Company asking us to test fuel octane, there's not even a labor time standard for it in Ford's manual.  Secondly, your PCM is not going to let the engine destroy itself.  I've worked on performance concerns on SVT Cobras where it ended up beint 87 octane in the tank.  The PCM will automatically adjust mixture, spark and fuel timings if it sees detonation, which it CAN see over the knock sensor.  You'll actually probably only knock once or twice on start up and I would be amazed if you heard it.  If a Cobra can run on 87 without damage, then a SVT Focus can surely run off 89.

Anyone, anyone. 
>>dxrflyboy|||Answer||| The cam sensor and synchronizer are separate components and can be replaced separately.  If you remove the cam sensor from the synchronizer and mark the position of the old synchronizer before removing it, mark the new synchronizer EXACTLY the same, and insert it in exactly the way the old one came out, everything should work fine.  It's no different than removing and reinstalling a distributor.  On the other hand, unless the synchronizer is making noise (squeaking), there is no reason to replace it.  The cam sensor bolts right on top of it and there are no adjustments to make.

>>>Title||| windstar transmission- RPM sensor
>>wackysci|||Original question||| I am not a car person- so beg the language here--One week ago took my 1998 ford windstar in -- told to get new transmission- torque converter out and I was told I was lucky and saved as new planetary bearings had to be replaced also. 
Now- the car &quot;reves up&quot; at 50 miles per hour . On interstate would not go over 30 and rpms were at 3.5. The transmission place first said the car drove perfectly but have now found that it does have a problem and also Kills when turning and when applying slight brakes when turning.- this has happened also just this week after they &quot;fixed&quot; the car.
They think it might be the RPM sensor...is this the same as a TRS- a transmission range sensor- or a VSS- vehicle speed sensor shouldn't they have diagnosed this at same time-- or could this have been the entire problem not the $2000 new transmission?? 
Any advice how to speak their language and get to the real problem-- to get them to refix this all for free under their warranty
- thanks-!

>>hain84|||Followup-question||| It is possible but things to consider
1. parts cost
2. time to do it
3. the ability to curse 
4. overall time and money
what im trying to say is that it is possible but the money spent on parts would be enough to buy a better truck with four wheel drive. In the end it would just be a pain in the butt.  Im sure Im leaving something out. I would save money and sell your current truck and get one with four wheel already. 
>>>Title||| Very High Idle at start up
>>Bigwilly1277|||Original question||| I have a 93 Exploer with a 4.0.  When I start it up every time, my idle will jump all the way up to around 2G's at stay at about 1500 for a very long time.  I just recently change the plugs and wires, and had a new injector put in.  My filters are new as well.  I just can't understand why it's running so high.  I mean this problem just started about a month ago.  In the past, when I started it up it would settle at around 800-900 like clockwork.  
Any ideas? 
>>carr17|||Answer||| It sounds to me like either your idle Air Control is getting stuck open at start up or the computer doesn't know it's coolant temp. Try replaceing the cooland sensor and cleaning out the idle air control with some electrical cleaner. Tell if this fixes the problem.

The German version used a V4, the British an Inline four.
They are classics these days in Britain and many of it's colonies (Mainly Australia and New Zealand, possibly Canada, I do not know)

>>briarrabbitt|||Original question||| I've recnetly been experiencing billowing clouds of blue smoke when I start the engine.  It goes away after a few minuites and does not smoke while driving, except when I accelerate hard.  I thought it was my valve stem seals so I replaced them but it still does the same thing.  Next I did a wet and dry compression test and all of the cyllinders where almost exactly the same so I don't think it's the rings.  Also, I changed the plugs twice in the past two months and both times the back two plugs (3 and 6) where completely fouled out black and caked up.  So far my oil consumption test shows 1 qt every 90 miles!  Any ideas? 
>>dxrflyboy|||Answer||| Two things come to mind:  PCV valve and intake gaskets.  A plugged PCV valve will push oil into the intake and if intake gaskets are leaking on the bottom sides of the ports, oil will be sucked into the cylinders from the lifter valley.

Check all vacuum hose. Move them and look at them to make sure they are not cracked/leaking.

I am a person with little knowledge about the mechanism of cars. Can anyone give me some more explanation? Thank you. 
>>pcv|||Answer||| You checked for a brake leak. That will effect your brake pedal going down and loosing brake pressure. In other words, you will not be able to stop effeciently. 
As soon as you start the engine, vacuum is created by the engine and  is required to run your vehicle. If it leaks, then you will have a problem like the one we suspect you are having right now.  Your idle control valve can also cause the same problem. If you know a good shop, take it there and get them to check it out.

 I run the stock shorties into a set of flowmaster mufflers through really short 2.5&quot; head pipes &amp; then out into 4' boom tubes. This truck is very quick, as it only weighs 2800 lbs with a full tank , BUT!!! its only quick in a STRAIGHT line!!!! still 1965 steering tech , Not that good!!!

>>youngpup03|||Answer|||  it has me seriously in aw hoping its not a 351m but that the mystery motor is a 351c plz reply or email me
>>Dan_in_WA|||Answer||| If it's the original engine, it's a 351 Cleveland.    
The 351 Modified didn't come out until 1975 or so.  Ford built that because they ran out of 351 Windsors, so they put 351W cranks in a 400 block and called it 351M. 
>>HiFlow5 0</span>|||Answer||| Dan is right about it being a 351C if your truck is a 70. In 74 the Cleveland was discontinued, and the 351M was born, but only in full size passenger cars. (the M actually has no meaning other then an internal Ford reference to differentiate between the Windsor, and Cleveland). The 351M was not used in trucks till 77, and production of the block ended in 79, but the motor still popped up in Bronco's till 82.
But the reason Ford went with the 351M in not because they ran out of Windsor blocks. That is totally false!
The 351 Windsor engine was designed for higher RPM duty in small to midsize passenger cars. The 351M is actually a de-stroked 400 motor. The 351M was mainly designed to meet the newer tough emissions laws that the older (360/390/428) engines wouldn't be able to meet. The 351M was also designed as a low end torque motor to replace the above motors in passenger cars.

I hope this helps. If you need any other help write me at  
>>Mercracer|||Answer||| From the front of the engine, it is similar to telling the difference between a 302 and a 351W.  
If the distributor mounting hole is even with the front mounting surface of the intake manifold, then you have a 351C.  If the mounting hole is deeper into the block, then it is a 351M.  The front inner corners of the cylinder heads are also raised above the distributor hole on the M vs the C. 
>>who fan|||Answer||| My experience with these motors is limited. My opinion is the 351C is a bad ass engine and 351M is a good boat anchor. 
>>racercarsman|||Followup-question||| i have a 351m in my 73 ford ranchero. the way to tell the difference between the two is that the 351m has a ridge that sticks out from the block on the front right next to the distributor
i myself dont see why every one is doggin the 351m it was mad to replace the 351c/w. the heads onthe 351m are the same as the 351c are the same as the 400/351m exept they have canted valves, wich means they are angled in the head to  have greater flow. alsothe differences between the 351m and the 400m are the crank shaft and the pistons, its not a windsor crank in the 351m. the  m-series is made for gobs of low end torq and power. 
>>Paul Masley|||Answer||| I had a 351M in an 85 F150 4X4.  Could not kill the thing.  When truck was totaled in 1992 it had over 300K.  The only thing replaced in the engine was the timing chain and gears.  Bet you could have pulled a head and looked through and could see the crank.  That truck got 22 mpg, regardless of it being empty or fully loaded, creeping in town or blasting down the interstate at 80.  I would love to find another one.

I bought a 1958 tudor 300 and the guy insested the engine was a 1971 torino but after looking at some of the ID numbers I knew something was wrong. after I found this the 351 site I now know that the motor is a 1977 or so F 150 but it is still a good project car and hope to have fun with it 
>>Samw|||Answer||| Actually, the &quot;351m&quot; and the &quot;c&quot; are both antique, boat anchors.
The late model 5.8L Windsor is a better engine.
It's a shame Ford discontinued the 5.8L in favor of the 4.6 and 5.4, overhead-cam wheezers. 
A sorry bunch indeed. If Ford wanted an economical powerplant, they should have re-issued the flathead. True, it burned a lot of oil, but you can't have everything.

I am a newby and needing some help with our 1996 ford taurus wagon. We purchased it back in July of this year from a used car dealer. It's a good car, but it has some problems. We had noticed that everytime it get's to about half a tank full of gas, it stalls when trying to drive. It does it when we push on the gas, give it a few moments, and it straighten s out only to do it again after we come to another stop. We fill it up, and it seems to be fine till it gets to a half of a tan or lower again. 
Now that's the first problem we have had. Here's the next one and it's wierd.
About a month ago it was low on oil. So my hubby be the oil in. It has a check engine light on, runs a little rough now, and of coarse it still stalls as well like always when it's half full. But the light blinks at times. no rhym in it, can't count it. Then at times it's just on. 
We have been told we need to pay $55 to get any service shop who is able, to get the codes out. I just haven't been able to afford that, but do know we need to. I was hoping with car doctors as yourselves are, maybe you could all help in determining the illness by the symtoms.

>>tempo42|||Original question||| Trying to fix my friends &quot;go to school car&quot; - 1972 Ford Tempo - 4 cylindar.  It won't idle well and stalls often - runs strong at speed.  &quot;Feels&quot; like it is flooding at idle.  I got into it late - others have worked on it - including a mechanic.  And I'm an amature - though a logical one - ha.  It apparently is a fairly recent problem - after she bought it and drove it awhile.
The first thing I need help on is the firing order.  One of her friends changed the plugs, distributor cap and wires.  I'm suspicous.   I've researched this and other sites and been to the library - finding several versions of the correct plug-to-distributor hook-up.  Can someone describe (to a novice) how to wire it correctly as a starting point?
I'm trying not to spend unnecessary money or time on it, so thought I'd retrace what others have done.  Can you help? Thanks a ton.

>>dxrflyboy|||Followup-question||| The idle problem may be a faulty Idle Air Control Valve (IAC or IACV).  It's bolted to the back side of the throttle body next to the EGR valve.  You will need a scan tool so you can monitor the duty cycle the PCM is commanding the IAC.  If the duty cycle percentage is high, chances are the IAC isn't operating properly and the PCM is commanding excess on time to compensate.
The firing order is 1-3-4-2.  Most distributor caps have a &quot;1&quot; molded into them by the #1 terminal.  I'll have to check where the #1 wire is on mine in case you don't have the &quot;1&quot; molded into the cap.  GBTY on that. 
>>tempo42|||Answer||| 
Quote:
>>dxrflyboy|||Followup-question||| The IAC may be a little hard to see because there is a plastic shield over the throttle body where the throttle cable attaches - you may have to remove that before you can see it.  It is held on by two small bolts.  If you pull it off, you will see two holes in the throttle body.  The IAC has two openings on it with a solenoid controlled valve that opens and closes to control the amount of bypass air to regulate the idle speed.  Since running fuel injector cleaner helped the idle a bit, it is probably worthwhile to do a professional fuel injector cleaning.  I've seen it work wonders on vehicles that were running like crap.  I would pursue this before doing anything with the IAC.  As far as cost goes, give your local parts store a call for a price.  Also, run a compression test on cylinder #1 to check for a burned valve or leaking rings before spending too much money on an IAC or fuel injector cleaning.  It doesn't make any sense to chase external problems if your engine has major internal problems that aren't worth fixing.

>>RedLightning|||Original question||| install non-ford performance parts into cars?  But would it could vary from dealer to dealer? 
>>drdisque|||Followup-question||| most won't, but why would you go to a dealer? They have the worst and least experienced technicians around. 
>>dxrflyboy|||Answer||| The worst and least experienced technicians at the Ford dealer I work at (must be all of us) will install customer supplied non-Ford performance parts.  One of my coworkers installed an ARB air locker in an F250 this week.  Obviously, we can only guarantee the work we do has been done right.  We don't guarantee any parts we don't supply.

>>Vrmaniac|||Original question||| Ok I got the friggin thing runnin, now. When i come to a stop it feels like a manual transmission coming to a stop with the clutch engaged. It shakes like crazy.
Things on the EEC say that the TPS is showing full throttle all the time. and a EGR valve problem. But would those cause this?
regardless i'm going to attempt to clean and if necessary replace the TPS, but if its actually the transmission i'm not sure this project is going to be worth the 700$ its going to cost for a tranny.

>>>Title||| Project 1949 Ford (56K Annihalation)
>>Rod&amp;Custom|||Original question||| A friend of mine  and I picked up an old '49 Ford in June. Here is some background information on the buildup. This car needed some serious TLC to say the least. He purchased the car for $1500(a fair price if you don't know much about these), and allowed me to help him get it back to the driving condition. We work well together(we just completed a 1928 Model A streetrod the previous winter) even though he is 64, and I am only 15. The man we purchased the car from had aqcuired it through a trade for something else, and didn't want it. We just happened to be looking for one for months, and this fit our bill nicely. Here are some pictures of the condition when it was rolled off the trailer and into the garage.  I hope you guys(and gals) enjoy seeing this buildup as much as I do working on it.
Here are a few looks at the subject.
[IMG][/IMG] 
[IMG][/IMG] 
>>TheSilentChamber|||Followup-question||| Looks like its in really good condition. I love the taillights on those. Having someone like that as a mentor type is great, I wish I would have had someone that would have helped me out and taught me stuff they had learned over the years. Most of the time you can learn 1000 times more from listening to older people's stories and advice than you can from any book. 
What are you plans for the car? Kinda makes me want to go buy the 65 dodge polara I'v had my eye on for a while. 
>>Rod&amp;Custom|||Followup-question||| First of all I want to thank Mike for moving this for me. I think it might mean something to  you guys, and maybe inspire and shed light on metal work. Here are some more pictures of the original condition.
[IMG][/IMG] 
If you can't tell what your looking at, this is whats left of the passenger side floor and rocker. Looks strong, eh?
[IMG][/IMG] 
And this is the drivers side, just below the pedals.
[IMG][/IMG] 
Passenger side floor and kick-up.
[IMG][/IMG] 
I have the pictures, but downsizing them is very time consuming, so I will post more later. The actual fabrication part is next, and there is ALOT of it! 
>>Rod&amp;Custom|||Answer||| It is quite a project, but it is moving very fast considering it's condition. Having someone older really is nice. We work as a good team. He keeps my crazy ideas in check, and I throw fresh approaches to problems in to him. I really love saving the older cars that otherwise would have parted, or rotted out. The plans for it is a mild custom. It will have frenched taillights and headlights, shaved handles and emblems, a peaked hood, a peaked decklid, fender skirts, small block Chevy, either stock or '54 Chevy grille, and some other cool tricks. Polara sounds good too, love to see it's buildup if it happens. At this point, we are nearing the putty stage. Most metal is back in the car with the exception of the hood... Also, I learned to weld on this car, so the welds start out a little rough, but I like to think I am decent now. Hope everyone enjoys! 
>>TheSilentChamber|||Followup-question||| Do I spy a flathead? 
>>mike@af</span>|||Answer||| You're pretty damn lucky that you have parents that will let you work on a heap of shit, (not insulting you). They see rustbucket hot rods as just that, shitty old rustbuckets that Moses drove the river.
BTW, the new pics ain't workin' for me. 
>>Rod&amp;Custom|||Followup-question||| You do spy a flathead. I have numerous pictures of it coming up. I figured my pictures would fail sometime... anyone else having problems? You are right, I am pretty lucky to have the chance to work on these cars. I guess the figure it keeps me out of bigger trouble. Now that I start thinking of projects, a whole load come to mind. The small block which will probably be used in the '49 is in my shed, and I hope to pick up a '35 4 door Ford. I am a little off track though now.Here are some more, hope they work!
And the fabrication of a whole new wheel well begins...
[IMG][/IMG] 
The left front fender is lifted off to find out what is hiding under it...
[IMG][/IMG] 
Does everyone remember the floor... or lack of floor I should say. This is the rear section under the rear seat of the drivers side... This is his welding, when he was teaching me( a little gas, a little wire-fed).
[IMG][/IMG] 
He left the keys to his garage for a couple hours, and voala! A floor has been born. This job is all mine, good and bad. Sorry, I am missing the rocker install, but you can see the basics of it in this one(its just surface rust on it).
[IMG][/IMG] 
Another picture of the whole floor, kickup and all. The kickup was fabbed out of a Toyota decklid, and the rest of the floor was fabbed out of a GM van top(notice the strengthened rolls). I also missed pics of the under supports of the floor, running from the supports to the frame.
[IMG][/IMG] 
Ahh yes, the legendary flathead that Chamber spyed.
[IMG][/IMG] 
A better look...
[IMG][/IMG] 
This is where the trim used to reside. It will be replaced with Buick side trim(not the wide).
[IMG][/IMG] 
Thats all for now, but tommorrow I will post pics of the finished wheel well, finished passenger sided door and rocker, and finished trunk. I hope to run over and get some pics tonight. Right now it is down to bare metal, and nearing putty/primer. We hope to be into mudding by Thanksgiving. I know that this looks cheap, having not ordered the parts, but this is a REAL budget car. Also, it is being done correctly, with absolutely no fiberglass filler. We will be rolling undercoating on the floors soon, and then they will look perfect. Hope you guys are enjoying, and say something if you can't see the pics. 
>>TheSilentChamber|||Answer||| you can host the pictures here on the forums, click on the gallery link at the very top under the blue skyline. More reliable than the host your using. 
>>Rod&amp;Custom|||Followup-question||| I was trying to use that when I started, but wasn't able to, so Mike suggested using ImageShack. Sorry, but it is all I can get to work for me right now.  
>>TheSilentChamber|||Answer||| If you send me a zip file with all the pictures in them, I'll resize them for them for you.  
>>mike@af</span>|||Answer||| Looks good R&amp;C Grant. Man oh man, only if you had a sand blaster to blast the hell out those floor boards and frame. 
>>Rod&amp;Custom|||Answer||| You can say that again... 
>>TheSilentChamber|||Followup-question||| Hey man, I resized all the pictures so that this thread will be dailup friendly, I'll mail them to you if you want? 
>>Rod&amp;Custom|||Answer||| Yea that sounds good. I put the pics in a zip file and tried  to send them to you, but it just kept loading them or something. Maybe I'll try again. Thanks for helping get these pics up right.

>>>Title||| Blinking Check Engine when accelerating through 75
>>andr3w|||Original question||| Sorry to crosspost, but I really could do with an answer. 
I drive a '96 ford aspire, manual trans. Sometimes (Not always) while on the freeway, when accelerating through 75mph, the check engine light starts blinking. So far every time this has happened I've slowed down to 65 or slower right away, and then it stops, and the light just remains solid. 
I want to think my sparkplugs just need to be replaced, and it's misfiring a little because they can't keep up with the engine at this speed-- the car has 60,000 miles and they've never been replaced. When I got the clutch replaced, the mechanic said they could do with replacement &quot;soonish&quot;
After a little while of the Check Engine light being solid on, it goes out on its own, so I've not worried about it that much.
And I've checked the engine. It's in there.
It does, however, scare the crap out of me, can anyone offer any wisdom? 
>>timetowinarace|||Followup-question||| More often than not it's an oxegen sensor. If you have good oil pressure, good water temp, and your altanator-battery is working properly your not in bad shape. The light means a sensor is not getting the proper reading. This could be an engine problem or simply a sensor problem as with the ox sensor. Natural deposits cause them to fail. Bad spark plugs should not cause the light to come on. Not even a miss would do this. Of course, your not saving money by waiting to change them-especially with todays gas prices and extra wear on the engine. 
Your mechanic is the one that has the proper diagnostic equipment to find which sensor is sending bad information and why. If money is an issue, as with most of us, I would feel fairly confident in driving the car for some time as it is if the above mentioned items are okay.
Time 
>>andr3w|||Answer||| thank you for your reply. Someone from another forum also suggested that it's probably the oxygen sensor. Since it's never been replaced, and the car is in otherwise good repair, that's probably it. The other person suggested that it could be an ignition problem... since neither the plugs nor the o2 sensor have ever been replaced, I may as well replace both just to cover all my bases. 
Hopefully it's not a hard job, i'll visit the library for a copy of the repair manual and see.
thanks again!

>>>Title||| 1993 Ford Tempo tranny fluid leak and engine swap
>>Zebisko|||Original question||| My friend has a /93 Tempo 4 cylinder    Does anyone have any idea as to what the problem is? Also, he wants to change it to a V-6. Would it be possible to use a Taurus engine in it? Any help would be... helpful. 
>>dxrflyboy|||Followup-question||| You need to be more specific as to where the fluid is leaking from.  There are several possibilities.
Ford put the 3.0L 2V V6 in the Tempo during the last few years of production.  It had different exhaust manifolds, water pump, and drive belt setup than the Taurus.  Your best bet is to buy a driver V6 Tempo.  If all you can find is a V6 parts car, you could do a swap, but the wiring is bound to be difficult. 
>>Zebisko|||Followup-question||| I cannot pinpoint the location because it is leaking very slowly.(about half a quart a week)I haven't been to his house in a while, so I haven't been under it but once, in which I had not known that it leaked. 
>>dxrflyboy|||Followup-question||| A pint a week should be enough of a leak to see where it's coming from.  Start with the highest point closest to the front of the car where you see fluid.  That's usually the source. 
>>Zebisko|||Answer||| Ok, I am going to try and get over there this weekend or next week. Thanks for the help so far. 
>>Zebisko|||Answer||| Yeah, I FINALLY checked it out and it is at the back of the pan, and there is a little orange thing on it. 
>>dxrflyboy|||Followup-question||| The pan gasket relaxes over time, which means the bolts aren't holding tight anymore.  You might be able to fix it by just tightening the bolts (worked on mine).  Worst case, you'll have to change the gasket.  That orange thing is just a deflector of some sort, probably to keep fluid leakage off the spinning axle shaft, I'm guessing. 
>>Zebisko|||Answer||| Thank you, you have been extremely helpful! 
>>>Title||| Windstar hitch
>>joe990|||Original question||| How is the hitch bolted to the frame of a 98 Windstar? There seems to be no way to get the bolts inside the frame channel or to hold them after while tightening. Do you have to remove the back bumper or take up the floor mats? Or is fishing involved. What's the secret?
Thanks,

>>ModMech|||Answer||| Fishing.
The bolts are droped thru by using wire to guide them, and have &quot;ears&quot; on them so they don't turn while you tighten the nuts down from below.

>>benswolf_1|||Original question||| OK I have a 67 ford galaxie and am going to get new gears for the rearend and want to know how high I can go to do good at the strip and still be able to drive it around town I was thinken of some 4.11's but want your opinions- I will barely ever drive on a highway with this car so its all in town driving if that helps. Thanks! 
>>Madcat455|||Followup-question||| You should really match the gears to your engine &amp; trans.  Compression, cam profile, converter, trans... all play a part in deciding which gear to run.  As well as suspention &amp; tire choices (although they are a lesser part).
for example... A engine that reaches peak HP &amp; Torque at say 5000rpm &amp; higher would benifit from a 4.11 or greater... 
while a engine that hits it numbers at lower RPM's would just rev out of its power band too soon with that gear.
I'd dyno your engine.. see where it makes it numbers &amp; go from there. 
>>>Title||| 93 ford escort overheating
>>bgfergy|||Original question||| i bought a 93 ford escort for my girlfriend about 2 weeks ago.  the guy i bought it from said it would overheat after 10-20 minutes from starting it.  he said he wasnt sure the reason why it overheated, but he said when the a/c is turned on, the electric fan by the radiator turns on and the temperature gauge returns to normal.  but as soon as you turn off the a/c, the fan turns off and soon the temp gauge rises.  i thought it sounded funny since the a/c would make the engine overheat faster.  but he was right, it starts to overheat and i turn on the a/c and the temperature goes down.  what would cause this?  thermostat?  bad sensor?  i am going to take it to my mechanic, but if its the thermostat, i can change that easy enough...i think.

This &quot;gadget is 2 and 3/4 inches long. Has a triangle end that attaches to the carburetor with three screws. On the other end is a two prong unit that receives a connector with two wires.

>>johnson02118|||Original question||| 89 Ford T-bird, 3.8L engine, no supercharger. 115,000 miles. Suddenly developed fast idle problem.  Dealer claims I need a new throttle body.
Drove home 300 miles from vacation on Sunday. Car ran great. Turned car off to drop off passanger. Started ok. Turned car off to unload my luggage. Car started ok. Pulled into a parking space, and when I put the car in park, suddenly began fast idle. Approx 2,000 RPM in park.  Approx 1,100 in drive.
Brought it to the dealer today. They claim I need a new throttle body. They said diagnostics checked out ok. I'm sure that dealer did not remove throttle body, external inspection only. Says internal plate stuck. Problem is that throttle body is no longer manufactured. Need to find used or rebuilt.
Also need muffler - baffles shot. Dealer and Meineke both say that obstructed muffler would not cause fast idle problem. Meineke won't replace muffler until idle corrected.
Does this sound reasonable? Any suggestions? Any recommendations for used parts dealer on line?
Thanks 
>>freeclimber|||Answer||| You can try unsticking the throttle plate by cleaning the carbon/oil buildup inside and then using penetrating oil on the external parts. Sounds like the sticking is still pretty minor. 
>>johnson02118|||Answer||| Thanks for the reply.  I brought the car to a local garage, and they identified and replaced the idle air control motor - a lot cheaper and easier than finding a complete throttle body.  Thanks again. 
>>>Title||| Ford Alternator bearing failure
>>samiam88|||Original question||| Hi, the alternator on my Ford E250 seized today. I replaced it with a brand new unit and within 40 miles the new one also seized. The auto parts tech said that this problem is due to the alternator not being grounded well enough. He claims that if I run a new ground wire from the alternator to the engine that it will fix the problem. He claims that the aluminum bracket that the alternator is mounted on is a dissimilar metal from the steel engine block which will cause corrosion between the aluminum and steel not allowing the alternator to ground properly, consequently, this overheats the bearings causing them to fail.
    Does this make sense to anyone??? 
>>FlamingTaco|||Answer||| Yes, this does occur. You replacement alternator, though, should not have failed within 40 miles. Take it back. 
>>samiam88|||Answer||| Thanks for the reply. Many people that I have talked to have said the same thing that you did. The parts store replaced the alternator and I installed it along with a ground strap from the alternator to the block. I also ran another ground strap from the block to the chassis just to be sure. Hopefully, it will solve the problem............... I am getting tired of changing it, it is a pain in the #$!@ 
>>freeclimber|||Followup-question||| Isn't the ground strap a &quot;dissimilar metal&quot; from the aluminum body of the alternator?
I say clean the mating surfaces well (more surface area to make contact than the ground strap connector) and call it good.
I also agree that 40 miles of service =junk part.

>>Jim_McQueen|||Original question||| I own a 1987 ford country squire and now I have to unhook the battery whenever I am not driving it. 
This pisses me off.
Not to mention the battery itself is a brand new duralast.
I unhooked it last night and this morning I hooked it back on, the fucking battery was dead again!!! 
It's got to be the alternator, right? 
I think maybe something is short-circuited.
What in the hell should I be fucking looking for?! 
>>Fritz The Cat|||Followup-question||| How do you know the battery is dead? Does the car not turn over? Have you turned on the headlights to see if they come on brightly or dim? Did you try to start the car again after you shut it off but before you disconnected the battery? It could be battery, voltage regulator, alternator, cables, or starter. Need more info to narrow it down. Try the above things and get back to us. 
>>pcv|||Answer||| You might have a bad alternator. Measure the voltage across the battery terminals with the vehicle running, it should be 13-14 volts. If not, its a bad alternator. If it is, then by the time you get home, the battery is depleted of charge. You disconnect it and reinstall it the next morning to a dead battery. It will not start. If the battery is charged and you disconnect it and the next morning it will not start, then you might have a bad battery. That has been know to happen. Don't be surprised. Another thing could be happening is that the battery is tall and is grounded by the hood, killing the battery. Check it out and good luck to you. 
>>Unit 5302|||Answer||| The alternator most likely has a short in the internal rectifier (diode trio for you GM fans) and it's allowing current to cross back through the alternator the wrong way and dissipate through the car.
Take a test light or a good multitester.  Disconnect the negative battery cable, and put the positive pin on the terminal, and the negative pin on the post.
The battery drain should light the test light up like a christmas tree and the drain should be over 1amp.  Now disconnect the plug in on the alternator and try it again.  If your drain drops dramatically, you've found the problem. 
>>christianrider|||Answer||| If none of the above suggestions work, try this:
Make sure ignition is in the off position
Remove the positive cable from battery. 
Next one by one, remove a fuse
go back and check with a test light betweent he positive cable and battery post. 
If light does not come on, then move to your next fuse.
If it does, then you possibly have found the circuit that is giving you trouble.

>>freeclimber|||Followup-question||| If you have a battery that is known to have %100 charge and after a period of minutes or hours it dies, w/o being connected to a circuit that could drain it, then your battery is a dud.
If the %100 battery only dies when allowed to sit while connected to the vehicle's cables, check for parasitic drain.
If your battery is not properly charging during driving, check connections, etc. and alternator output.

>>bae007|||Original question||| 1989 Ford LTD Crown Victoria 302 5.0  Power steering gone bad.  Pump has been replaced and lines are all in good condition.  Power steering fluid heats up to boiling point in under five minutes with car idiling.  Steering wheel turns byitself,  Power steering kicks in and out.  But the pump and lines are ok.  I removed the steering box and inspected the worm gear which seems to be ok.  The problem seems to be in the box on the end of the worm gear where the lines feed in.  I have looked in Haynes manuals,  Every Chiltons manual you can think of, but there is no info on how this part works.  Most people say just replace it but that is $122.00 that I don't need to spend if I could only find info on this part.  I think there are bearings inside and if I could find some sort of schematics or just general info I could repair that.  I think the part is called a Ford intergrated power assist .. something or other.  CAN ANYONE HELP ME TO FIND MORE INFO ON THIS.

It's a smooth stop from 70 to 0 IT'S not warped rotors..
so what i'm asking is would air in the systems cause the ABS not to work right??????????? 
>>rivguy|||Answer||| the problem you are talking about is caused by a bad speed sensor, most problably a front on this vehicle, the air gap has gotten to big probably due to rust under the sensor mount on the hub, at low speeds it looses the signal and causes the system to think that wheel has locked up

>>wclark|||Original question||| 1997 Ford Escort 2.0 4cylinder automatic with 130,000 miles.
Suddenly the speedometer is intermittenly working and when it is not working the trans is not shifting correctly. the speedometer says 0mph sometimes and then bounces back and forth from the actual speed back to 0? the trans will shift into OD for a few seconds, then do an abrupt downshift to 2nd I think. Then when you press the throttle the engine just revs up with no increase in forward motion . At a certain point as the vehicle is slowing down the trans will catch and start going again. I have only had this happen when the speedometer is not working. (also odometer stops)If when it won't go I down shift into 2nd manually and then shirt back into drive it will start to go again.
everything then works normal for a mile and then trouble repeats.
Yes engine light is on.

>>>Title||| IAT modules
>>critterfur|||Original question||| im working on a 95 F150 with a 5L and kinda got lost looking for the IAT module. the info i got from an online manual reads like this 
&quot;Typically, the IAT sensor is approximately 1&quot; X 1&quot; X 1&quot; and uses a two wire circuit. Most likely the sensor will be located on the intake tube, in the air box or near the throttle body. If the vehicle uses a Mass Air Flow/IAT combination sensor, MAP/IAT combination sensor or Air Flow Meter, locate it now. To verify the position of the IAT sensor you may test the sensor plug, (with the key switched to the accessory setting) with a voltmeter. The IAT should be approximately a 5-volt circuit&quot;

>>>Title||| 1992 Ford Tempo Stereo Wire Configuration
>>Tydye|||Original question||| So after a painful process, I have 2 new front speakers installed, and only 4 freaking wires away from haveing the new stereo itself installed in my ex-girlfriends car. I need to know which wire's are positive, remote, negitive, ect... Please help. She's worried I wount finish it, and I'm trying to win her back. So any help is GREATLY appriciated. Cheers! 
>>PepsiBlueFloat|||Followup-question||| You want to know the wires on the stereo or on the car? Usually on the stereo they are labeled on it itself. On the car there should be 4 wires to the stereo from the car (not including speakers). a red, yellow, black. Black is obviouly the ground; red and yellow sometimes are different. One of them is battery, the other is to you ignition. A voltmeter is an easy way to figure out which is whihc. One will have no charge when ignition is off, the other will. I dont know if i mis-understood your question...but this is a reply to what i thought it was. heh. hope it helps.
oh and the 4th wire im talking about is the antenna...the big giant one...it unmistakeable---and it only can plug in one place. 
>>Tydye|||Answer||| Unfortunetly fords arnt that simple. I have a big green wire with a grey strip, and other odd ball colours. Its not color coded like a normal stereo. I already have the speakers hooked up. I guess Ican just use new wires instead of trying to splice them witht he ones that were origonaly hooked into the stock stereo, 
>>dxrflyboy|||Followup-question||| Make it easy on yourself.  Grab an adapter plug from Wally World or a stereo store, splice it into the aftermarket radio harness, and plug it in.  Hopefully you didn't throw the original connectors away already!  If you did, at least the adapter kit should clue you in as to where the wires go. 
>>PepsiBlueFloat|||Answer||| Is this a stock stereo you're installing new speakers to, or a new stereo w/ new speakers...sry im still a little confused. Ive installed stereos in my ranger, my friends ranger, and my f150 w/o any problem. I dont think im understanding your question fully 
>>Tydye|||Followup-question||| I took out the stock speakers in the front doors and replaced them, I figured out the speaker wire configuration (Note both positive and negitive wires had a white stripe) I took out the stock stereo and I'm replacing it with a pioneer. Now as far as the power, neg, ect... wires are concerned there are 5 of them plus the attenna plug. and the 5 wires I'm left to work with are like a green wire (all wires have white stripes) which is slightly bigger than the other 4 wires wich are coloured like violet, cyan, off the wall colors. Not your normal color codes... So with there being 5 wires, what would they be for? A Remote, a Power, a Negitive, but what about the other two? 
>>PepsiBlueFloat|||Followup-question||| these 5 wires are coming from the pioneer stereo or from inside the dash? If they are coming from the stereo it should say right on top of the cd deck on a sticker, or on the instruction booklet what each wire is for EXACTLY. Now, if you're talking about whats coming from inside the dash;  unless you've got something like steering wheel volume control or whatnot you should only need 3 of the5 wires. Here is what should be.
2 speaker wires for each speaker (positive and neg dont usually matter) they will be labeled on the wires with LF+ and LF- (left front) and RF+ and RF- (right front) -- just make sure both &quot;L&quot; wires go to the left speaker and both &quot;R&quot; wires go to the right speaker.
Then look at the wires coming out of the dash. If what im understanding there are 5 of them not including the antenna. To get the CD unit to turn on there needs to be 3 different powers going to it. The ground wire (negative). Its a black wire. The other two wires out of the 4 remainging are going to be tuffer to find out which is which if they are wierd colors. Coming out of the back of the stereo there is a yellow wire and a red wire. They yellow wire is always connected to the battery -- its used to store presets, keep the clock right, and settings and stuff. The red wire connects to the ignition switch. When the car is turned on it get power and turns the actuall unit on. Stereo wont work w/o this one. Now; when i say red and yellow wires coming out of the stereo -- they may be different for yours, justlook on that sticker on the stereo. They should be labled with IGN/PWR (red)  and BTRY/BTR (yellow) or something along those lines.
you may just have to try all 4 of those remaining wires to see which is which if you dont ahve a voltmeter. The two wires you have left coming out of the dash at the end i have no idea what they might be for since the car ispretty old. But they are not needed for the stereo to run, so if the stereo is working right just cap/tape them off.

>>dxrflyboy|||Followup-question||| I'm not sure what ignition system your engine has, but the Ford TFI ignition system has a trouble prone module.  The TFI module screws onto the side of the distributor and fails freqently due to excessive heat.  If your ignition is TFI, chances are the module is the problem. 
>>>Title||| fuel gauge/pumping problems
>>gibby48|||Original question||| I have a '91 Explorer and it has about 169,000 miles on it.
My fuel gauge stopped working. It is below the E while driving, but goes up toward 1/4 tank when cold. 
I am also unable to fuel like normal.  The pump shuts off dozens of times as I try to fill it. I cannot pump but at the slowest of rates, barely squeezing the handle. 
Are these related/repairable?  I've tried to keep tabs and I really don't think it is anywhere near full. 
Today it only took 4 gallons (pumping the same slow way) and spilled like it was topped off.  
Any ideas?  Thanks in advance. 
>>dxrflyboy|||Followup-question||| I have my doubts the problems are related, unfortunately.  Your Explorer probably has an anti-slosh/siphon valve in the filler neck that is stuck closed.  This valve is supposed to open when you fill the tank and close when fuel sloshes against it from inside the tank.  Your gauge problem is most likely a faulty sender.  The bad news is the gas tank has to come out to replace the sender.  The good news is the slosh valve is easy to get to with the tank out. 
>>gibby48|||Followup-question||| Is this something that will cost a lot to fix?  I would guess mostly labor charges.  But my family mechanic we've had for almost 20 years is the best.  Thanks for the reply dxrflyboy. 
>>dxrflyboy|||Answer||| The sender and the fuel pump may be one unit.  If not, it's a good idea to change the pump with the sender while the tank is out.  I would figure no more than $300 for parts, including the pump, plus a few hours labor.

>>Badachew|||Original question||| I bought a ranger with a 302 put in it, but there is no neutral safety and I cannot spot it... as I don't know where to look, the guy told me the motor and tranny both came out of a 80 Granada 302, if anyone could tell me where to look to find it? and if it doesn't have one, where can I get one that will work for it? 
>>Doug Rodrigues|||Answer||| First of all, I'll admit to never have worked on a Ranger with an automatice transmission before, so this is going to be a generic answer.  If a neutral switch isn't obvious in the engine compartment, take a look on the steering column under the dash.  If the C-4 transmission is anything like the C-6 transmission, there isn't a neutral switch on the transmission. 
>>>Title||| Ac Question
>>police interceptor|||Original question||| 98 Ford Crown Vic.  I know there is a hot or high side and a cold/low side to a veh. ac system.  (I'm not sure of the values), but I watched as the tech connected the gauges to the system and saw that the pressure would rise to 55, then the radiator electric cooling fan would come on, then the pressure would fall to 25 then the fan would cut off, then the pressure would immediately begin to rise to 55 again and the process started over again and again and again.
The ac is not cooling properly.  Is the pressure rising because not enough air is passing over the coils to cool the hot/high side, then falling when the fan comes on and cools it?, and, is it normal for the pressure to flucuate so much?
Is the fan going on and off because of the pressure change in the AC system?, or is the pressure changing because the fan is coming on and going off?..or it is &quot;what came first the chicken or the egg?&quot;??
Bottom Line, IS THIS A FACTOR IN THE FACT THE AC IS NOT COOLING PROPERLY, AND WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE TO FIX IT?
Thanks in advance! 
>>dxrflyboy|||Followup-question||| What you describe is usually a symptom of an undercharged A/C system.  The compressor will operate only if there is adequate system pressure.  When the compressor engages, the cooling fan also comes on to ensure there is air flow across the condenser.  If the low side pressure drops too low, the compressor disengages and the fan turns off.  This will occur even if the system is fully charged, since the low side pressure will drop off when the refrigerant is very cold.  But if there is insufficient refrigerant charge, the high side pressure will also be low and there will be inadequate cooling. 
>>Doug Rodrigues|||Answer||| If you have gauges, your high side pressure should be at least 250 lbs. but not over 300.  With R-134, I'd keep it at 250-260. 
>>>Title||| Legal action options????
>>brettjoe|||Original question||| Hey All,
I just recently bought a 96 Taurus from a private seller.  I test drove the vehicle for a good hour on a Wednesday evening, then decided to buy the vehicle on Friday.  EVERYTHING looked fine, sounded fine, ran fine, etc.  On that Friday, on the way home from purchasing the car, the o/d off light came on, and would not kick into that next gear. In addition, the engine started to smoke, which I just attributed to oil leaking.  (Which I sorta knew it had a problem with.)  Working for a company that produces Ford Workshop Manuals and Repair Manuals, I was able to find out that the problem is most likely a bad overdrive clutch and the seals are leaking...meaning a new rebuilt transmission needing to be done!!!  I havent been able to take it in anywhere, because I dont have the time NOR the money for a new trans., but I did call the seller and let him know I was having these problems.  The actual seller will never talk on the phone, but his partner in the garage will.  They say bring it in and they will look at it.  Here's my question:  DO I HAVE ANY LEGAL RECOURSE IN THIS SITUATION?  IS THERE ANY SITUATION WHERE A SELLER CAN BE MADE TO REPAIR A DEFECT, AT THEIR COST, THAT I AM QUITE CERTAIN THEY KNEW EXISTED, YET SOLD THE CAR UNDER MISLEADING CIRCUMSTANCES?  I paid $1800 for the car, and the mechanics I have talked to say the new trans will run the same amount.  What are my options?  I need help as I do not have the money to be just throwing it around.
-brett 
>>dxrflyboy|||Followup-question||| Did the seller offer any kind of warranty with the car?  Dealers and garages in my state must offer a 3 month/3000 mile warranty on most cars, but there is a price cutoff, below which a warranty does not have to be offered.  If the garage stands behind the car they sold you, they will most likely put a used trans. in the car.  If they tell you it's your problem, you will probably end up taking them to small claims court to settle the matter.  You will also most likely lose.  I hope you can get some satisfaction from the garage, even though I doubt they knew there was a problem with it.  A guaranteed used transmission is also another option, if you end up eating the repair. 
>>93 CAPRICE LTZ 5.7|||Answer||| check your state for a lemon law! FYI transmission shops make big$$$ from ford &amp; chrylser transaxles!
your cars resale value may have a say in wether or not you want to put a new trans in your car. Also the owner did know this trans was bad. I know because they usualy start to slip and shudder under moderate to heavy acceleration. Depending on your driving style you may have not noticed on your test drive but I garantee it had the symtoms I mentioned.the owner will not talk to you because of his guilt and the mechanic is seeing big$$$$$$!! 
>>Doug Rodrigues|||Followup-question||| Unless you can prove that the seller knew that there were problems with the vehicle and hid the facts, at least in the State of Nevada, you're stuck with the car.  
There is such a thing as an &quot;Implied Warranty,&quot; that says that the purchaser of any non-particular item should expect the item (in this case, an automobile) to be worth closely what the buyer paid for it.  However, buying from a private party isn't included in the &quot;Implied Warranty,&quot;  at least in my state.  I suggest that you phone the District Attorney's Office in your area for an opinion in this matter.  My gut feeling is that you're stuck with the car as-is. 
>>>Title||| Water in oil - 89 ford 2.3liter i/o on my boat
>>aerioux|||Original question||| I have a i/o boat  with a 89 ford 2.3l engine. I am getting water in my oil 
Could this be caused by anything other than a cracked block or blown head gasket? If not is there a way to troubleshoot without tearing it down to the headgasket?
Thanks for any suggestions 
>>Wolf|||Answer||| I'm sure there are other ways it could happen, but the most likely is the HG. 
>>chaddyp|||Followup-question||| Some engines, typically Ford and Dodge have a tendancy to build up condensation... probably a breathing problem of some sort.  It depends on how much water is in the oil... if there is a white froth built up on the oil spout/cap, it could just be from condensation and water vapor.  Again, it depends on how much water is in the oil 
>>jlewis|||Followup-question||| Foamy crap and sludge = condensation (not bringing engine up to temperature for water to boil out of oil or PCV system not working right)
Water in oil when you drain the pan or oil turning to milkshake = blown HG or water getting into the boat and flooding through the seals (if that's possible), sorry I don't know a lot about boats but I doubt that your boat is flooding or you would be less worried about the engine! 
>>Doug Rodrigues|||Followup-question||| I concur with Jlewis.   People don't realize that running an engine cold will cause water vapor to condense inside the engine.  That can happen if you only run a cold engine for a couple of minutes and then turn it off, OR if your thermostat is stuck wide open.  Usually when a thermostat goes bad, it almost always becomes stuck closed.  The possibility is that perhaps you don't even have a thermostat installed?  Check to see if one is even installed on the engine.  
Do you notice any strange looking stuff in the coolant?  If the head gasket is defective, or if a cylinder is cracked you would see a slow accumulation of brown &quot;stuff&quot; in the coolant.  There is another way to check for leaks, but most auto shops don't sell a leak-down tester that airplane mechanics use.

>>>Title||| supercharged 429?
>>xyfalconsrock|||Original question||| Ok i just heard my uncle is building a AC cobra as a kit car.It's gonna be ready in a year anyhow.He said about chucking in an injected 429(7.0L) and then he said he was gonna put on a blower.But not one of those centrafugel ones, the ones that sit on top of the manifold like a 6/71 or somthing.My question is; with that kind of set up and on say 10 inch road tyres, who fast would he be running the quarter?
thanx 
>>thunderbird muscle|||Followup-question||| What kind of tranny, rear end gear?  List all you can and you will probably get a decent estiment. 
>>xyfalconsrock|||Followup-question||| i noe, sorry i dont have much more infomation about the car but its not all for sure yet.i new i couldnt get a great estimant with so much doubt but thanx.i hope to update when i noe more about it. 
>>jlewis|||Followup-question||| well, for starters a base 429 was rated at 380 HP but lets be more realistic and say it was actually about 450 HP and nearly the same torque(that is much more realistic BTW, they were seriously underrated).  Then if you run a blower at say 8 psi then you are treating the engine to approximately 60% more air than it would get naturally so subtract some efficiency losses and I'd say the engine should make somewhere around 700-800 HP.  i hope at this point that you have some good parts in the bottom end.  subtract about another 15% from that if you're running a slushbox (auto) and about 10% if manual. so you should be able to put 600 HP to the ground.  Geez that's a VERY rough estimate but you can see where I'm heading.  None of that's even considering what head work you do or what cam you run if you run other than stock parts.  Also it will take a lot of carb and exhaust to support that kind of power.  i'm sure exhaust won't be a problem if you have cobra sidepipes.  
>>jlewis|||Followup-question||| Also, a 600 WHP vehicle that weighs 2200 with driver (this is what I'm guessing for a cobra) should run 9's in the quarter assuming you can hook all that power and drive perfectly, so expect 10's from it on 10 inch street tires, maybe 9's if you're really good. 
>>xyfalconsrock|||Answer||| thanks for the report and estimate.BTW itll be an injected 429, i cant wait to see it ready.thanks for the help.

>>Fritz The Cat|||Followup-question||| Try following the positive battery cable to see where it goes, it should lead you right to the starter. 
>>terry arnold|||Answer|||    does the engine turn over while attempting to start, or are you getting nothing at all let me know. 
>>pcv|||Followup-question||| Assuming that you have no crank from your starter, this is what you got to do. On the drivers side, under the hood there is a starter solenoid with 3 or 4 terminals. One of your positive cable goes to it.Thats the solenoid. There is a little wire on that solenoid. Unplug it. Now, using a big screw driver jump power from the battery terminal of the solenoid to that small terminal that you just unplugged. The ignition should be in the on position when doing this. If your starter does not crank now then you have a bad starter. Good Luck. 
>>rodney10|||Followup-question||| just installed starter on 1993 tempo and new solenoid followed instuctions on wiring to solenoid but dont think i have it right now when i crank the car the starter wont disengage plus when i turn on the ac or try to roll down windows(power) the car shut off can any body help with this problem with the wiring? thanks i have the pos battery cable to the b terminal starter motor cable to the m terminal ignition to s terminal where do all the others go? 
>>dxrflyboy|||Followup-question||| The main battery cable must be attached to the large terminal furthest from the starter.  The start wire connects to the &quot;s&quot; terminal.  The other wires, which should have fusible links, piggyback on the main battery cable.  Do not attach any wires to the solenoid output terminal (closest to the motor, has a connection running to the motor).  If the replacement starter has a second small terminal (usually marked with &quot;I&quot;), ignore it.  That terminal is only to supply additional voltage to the ignition coil during startup on old cars with point type ignition systems.

>>Rmasters3|||Original question||| I have a 1996 Cougar, and have a new 22,000 miles Ford warranty engine in a car with 72,000 miles on the odometer.  I have a persistant ping on acceleration or under any modest load (like driving up a decent grade). A year ago I replaced the air flow sensor, and this ping went away (but has returned).  After replacing the air flow sensor a year ago, the engine really perked up, too.
Same thing happened with a 1994 I owned, too.  Ping until we replaced the air flow sensor, then went away.  Don't know if it's come back on that one as I no longer own the car.
Do I have to replace this every year or so to eliminate the ping and keep it running right?  Is there any sort of other mainatinance (I have tried premium gas, but it doesn't help much) like O2 sensors, etc. The plug wires are new and as I said the engine only has 22K on it (I use synthetic engine oil, too.) 
>>ModMech|||Followup-question||| There is no need to replace the MAF sensor unless it is totally inoperative.  Usually it just gets dirty, and the single biggest cause is the K&amp;N air filters some people insist on using.

3.big hugantic wafts of smoke began to pour fluidly from the ass end of my car...i don't exactly know why this started at this particular moment in time... my only guess is that it was very very funny for some greater being to watch this all happen at once to my pathetic ass
4.as i was trying to roll to the side of the interstate to pull over so i wouldn't die...a semi sped past me and kicked a rock about the size of a fuckin watermelon into my windshield... needless to say, once i realized that i wasn't beind shot at, and i lifted my head back up above the wheel...i was rather displeased to find out that i could see everything around me very clearly...so clearly in fact that it looked as though there wasn't any glass there at all. you know why it looked that way? do ya? because there was a fucking hole in my winshield that i was looking through.
i blame this on dodge..., so... fuck you dodge, fuck you semi, fuck you transmission and speedometer... i hate you all (especially the speedometer)

>>instantkevin|||Original question||| I've read a little bit on modular engines. But I still do not understand why or how they can only have 4 or 2 valves. How do they work? What is different about a modular engine? Are they all overhead cams like imports? My brother has a 4.6 Mustang GT with such and engine. When we work on it is there anything special that needs to be done?? (my engine knowledge is based off of traditional 90degree small block chevys) 
>>ModMech|||Followup-question||| They don't have only 2 or 4 valves... total.  It is 2 or 4 valves per cylinder, and now even three.
They &quot;work&quot; by actuating the valves from one or two overhead cams per head.  2&amp;3 valve/cyl engines use a single cam per head, while the 4V/cyl engines use two cams per head.  The valves are actuated by roller followers that rest on the valve stem on one end, and a &quot;lash adjuster&quot; (spring loaded lifter) on the other end as a pivit point.  The cam is basically centered over the middle of the follower where the roller is. 
>>instantkevin|||Followup-question||| So the only thing that significantly differentiates a modular engine from a typical 4 banger import is in how the cam is manipulated, chain vs. lifter? (other than the obvious # of cylinders, and rev range)
3 valves is unsual. 2 for intake 1 for exhaust?

Mechanic two tells me that the flexiplate (similar to a flywheel but for an automaic?) was put in backwards. I understand it is concave like a contact lens or frisbee.
My questions are:
1) Is this possible? Most cars have a bolt pattern that does not allow 
this to happen. I presume that it is possible for a 94 aspire. 
2) Will having drove it this way for a 1 mile test drive possibly? likely? for sure? have messed up the transmission - torque converter - other part. 
3) If the flexiplate is in backwards is possible to run the car 10 miles?, 50 miles? 100miles? without hurting the car?
4) Is it possible that my old engine was driven for 11,000 miles with the flywheen backwards? 
Also, the car is a 1994 Ford Aspire, front wheel drive with a 1.3 Liter Engine and an automatic transmission.

>>97chevyman|||Answer||| ok, since the spark plugs look like that, it is an fe motor:
so it is either a 390 or a 428. ford stopped the 352 in 63 or so, and the 360 only seen trucks, the 406 and 410 were mercury and lincoln motors, the 330 361 and 391 were heavy service motors, so 390 and 428 is left.

I recall an article in one of the mags where someone tried to &quot;sportify&quot; a US Grenada with I-6 and manual tranny, adding an aftermarket exhaust, shocks, etc. IIRC, they made significant strides in making it more of a driver's car. 
>>FoxGranadaChuck|||Answer||| Yes, I think that the UK Granadas were good cars, but NOTHING in my mind beats the Fox-bodied Granadas.  It would have been interesting if the aforementioned UK Granada had been federalized and introduced into our market.  But, I digress.......
I simply wished that Ford had the tamarity in 1982 to drop the (then) new 5.0L H.O. V-8 under the hood of the Granada GLX.  They did something similiar to that in 1985 with the LTD LX, but it was too late.  But at least Ford did something different then.

>>91_T-Bird_HO_5.0|||Answer||| depends, you might have more vacume leaks than you think, i'd check the compression on all the cylinders, you might have a blown head gasket, i'd also think about replacing the distributor cap, rotary button, plugs, and plug wires 
>>72torino|||Answer||| I have replaced all the vacuum lines, the vacuum advance, distributor cap and rotor, and plugs and wires.  I also set the timing and adjusted the carburetor.  Theres nothing wrong with the vacuum lines now. 
>>91_T-Bird_HO_5.0|||Followup-question||| then you might have a blown head gasket, you're loosing compression somewhere, at least that's what it sounds like to me, theres a little gage thingy that you can buy, i can't remember what the name of it is, you screw it in where your spark plugs are and disconnect the distributor so the engine isn't getting any fire and you turn the engine over to check the compression on the cyilders, if you have good compression on one cylinder and another has compression lower than the good one, then you have a blown head gasket

>>>Title||| 4 cyl. runs rough for 1 min.
>>jvoiles|||Answer||| 93 mustang 4cyl. , starts fine and then about 20 seconds later starts sputtering and backfiring for about a minute. After that it runs fine unless I shut it off and leave it for a couple hours, then the process starts all over again. I had it scanned and no error codes were evident. I replaced the plugs and wires but no improvement. The mechanic told me that the aftermarket plugs and wires were not as good as the motorcraft parts, also said that 4 of the plugs were &quot;cold&quot; and 4 were &quot;hot&quot;. When I bought the plugs all 8 were the same and the parts store was unaware of the hot/cold plug scenario. 
Any help would be appreciated. 
>>dxrflyboy|||Original question||| Maybe the mechanic meant that one set of plugs was meant to be a higher heat range than the other set, and having all the plugs the same heat range means one set is mismatched.  Check with a Ford dealer to see if a different part number is used for each set.  I work at a Ford dealer, but I don't buy into all the crap about buying only OEM parts.  Sometimes they're better, sometimes not.  Sometimes they are the same as aftermarket in a different box.  Anyway, you need to find out which cylinder is misfiring, then find out why.  It could be anything from a vacuum leak to oil fouling, or anything in between, like a damaged spark plug/wire.  The time delay seems to indicate that the rough running occurs when the PCM goes into closed loop, causing a lean skip.  As the engine warms up and parts expand, the vacuum leak seals up enough to end the lean misfire.  Try spraying some carb cleaner around the intake manifold gasket when it runs rough.  If it smooths out, the intake is leaking.  Narrow it down to the offending cylinder.  If you get no joy, check into other possibilities, such as plug fouling, damaged ignition parts, carboned up combustion chambers/intake/exhaust ports, etc. etc.

>>>Title||| Using water to clean the combustion chambers
>>Webslinger60|||Original question||| What do you guys think of running water through the engine to clean the combustion chambers? Lets say you suspect a sticky valve, due to sludge on the top side &amp; not closing 100%.
I&#8217;ve gotten a few different opinions. 
One mech used to actually pour water into the carb at fast idle, with no problems. Then again my dad saw a guy blow an engine using just an eye dropper. The safest way I was told was to use a spray-bottle on &#8220;wide/mist&#8221;, and no more than a quart.
Then again, wouldn&#8217;t water just clean the underside/combustion-side of the valve and NOT the top where the sludge is?
I was also told to used GM&#8217;s &#8220;Top engine cleaner&quot; &quot;Seafoam&quot; or other things. Im not crazy about solvents. A little sludge on hi-mile rings is not a bad thing.  If you dis-lodge it, the cylinder may start to smoke. 
>>dxrflyboy|||Answer||| You are better off using quality, synthetic chemicals to remove carbon, sludge, varnish, etc. from your engine than using questionable methods such as water!  Carboned up piston rings will cause more smoke than otherwise!  I recently replaced an engine (service contract provider's choice) that had nothing wrong with it aside from carboned rings.  The rings had stuck with carbon and the car was blowing smoke rings!  I wouldn't have been too surprised if a few doses of engine flush had cleaned it up enough to eliminate the smoke and spark plug fouling!  I'm not saying that chemicals can fix a broken engine, but if the problem is sticking due to deposits, your best bet is to start with solvents that are formulated to clean them out without taking the engine apart. 
>>97chevyman|||Answer||| Do this. Get a can of sea foam. pour the sea foam in a clean cup. Start the engine and run it until it is up to operating temp. then take the vacume line going to the brake booster, and put it in the cup of sea foam until the engine dies. If it does not die kill it, might diesel for a couple of seconds. Let the engine sit for 20 minutes, and fire it back up and beat the living piss out of the engine. There will be blue and black smoke coming out, runn it until there is clean exhaust and do it again. Then after your second time. Fill up your truck and put a pint of marvels mystery oil in the tank, it will clean out the rest of the carbon and sludge.

>>syko|||Followup-question||| I'm not sure if I should post this as you have already sea-foamed it, but I've heard that water can bend the condrrods in the compression sequence. I'm new to this so I was wondering if you actually meant whilst the car was idleing? 
>>Webslinger60|||Followup-question||| Yes, you do it while the engine is idling (fast idle) and yes, it can be dangerous. You have to be carefull. I've seen dealer mechanics do it to 
&quot;trade-ins&quot; before they went to the wholesaler. They almost pour the water right in, cause they didnt care if the engine blew or not. Most of of time the engine sounded like it was gonna throw a rod from the rapid rise in compression &amp; blow all kinds of crap out the tailpipe, BUT all the engines survived the treatment. Then again my dad once saw a guy blow an engine, just using an eye-dropper. 
I used a spray bottle on fine mist, and also used a mix of ATF, as was
recommended by alot of web-buddies. The ATF is dilutes the rapid compression a bit &amp; also soaks the carbon build-up (supposedly)
It seemed to idle very slightly better, (after the plugs dried) after that
and after the Seafoam, a bit better again, but I cant be certain, cause the intensitiy of my drivabilitly problems were intermittant. 
Id say do this as a last resort on an engine that may need a rebuild soon anyway, so if somthing does let loose, it's not such a problem.
If it works &amp; drivability is better for another year, before the rebuild, so much the better. 
>>Doug Rodrigues|||Followup-question||| The idea behind decarbonizing an engine is to create temperature extremes. i.e. hotter...cooler...hotter...cooler.  That will break most of the carbon build-up off the cylinder heads and piston tops.  Some people use kerosene or just plain water to do it while revving the engine.  Kerosene will create a huge smoke cloud and probably bring the fire department running.  Water....be careful how much you slowly pour-in because the increase in cylinder pressure from the additional steam could cause damage, however I don't believe that a spray mist or an eyedropper worth of water would do anything to an engine...not even clean it out. The idea is to create that temperature extreme change to break the carbon loose.   I haven't done anything like this since before catalytic convertors were invented.  I suspect that blowing the carbon out would probably plug-up a catalytic convertor.  That being the case, perhaps the catalytic convertor should be removed prior to decarbonizing an engine. 
Decarbonizing an engine does work and make the engine run smoother or at least stop pre-ignition.  The only decarbonizing I've done in more recent times is with airplane engines, but that's a different ball game.  With airplane engines you have a mixture control.  With that control you go rich/cool...lean/hot...rich/cool...lean/hot.  Does the same thing as the kerosene or water technique.   And by the way....water injection has been used in airplane engines for 60 plus years.  It is one way of allowing a high power piston engine AND jet engines to produce maximum power but still remain within normal temperature limits.  The idea of using water in automobile engines may seem strange, but it's only strange because the public hasn't been aware of water usage in engines before.  Also, the EPA wouldn't have a word to say about using water. 
 Worried about stuck piston rings?....Marvel Mystery Oil.  We even use that stuff in airplane engines!  Sometimes you have to pour it into the cylinder and allow it to soak overnight, and then drain out the excess from the lower spark plug hole (two plugs per cylinder).  I guess in an automobile engine, you'd pour just enough into the cylinder to soak the rings and then fire the engine up the next day.  Boy, I bet that would smoke! 
>>Webslinger60|||Followup-question||| The reason I used a spray mist bottle was for better control over how much water went in. I’ve seen dealer mechanics actually pour water from a cup, and the engine would sound like it’s going to throw a rod. They usually did this, with “trade-ins”, that they didn’t care about. If the engine got damaged, they’d just send it to a wholesaler, who’d either put in a used engine or break it up for parts.
Since this was my OWN car, (and a hi-mile one) I didn’t want to take that chance. Doug is right though about the mist not being as effective as direct-pour. I cant honestly say of the water-misting, or the Seafoam did any good, because I had a major vacuum leak, either in the carb or manifold gaskets. A week later I installed a new aftermarket manifold (with new gaskets of course) and a new small 4bbl carb. 
And it ran 95% better. The idle is still not dead-smooth, because a comp-check revealed pressure loss through three cyl’s valves. Im hoping they are not burnt, but just not closing all the way due to crud on the seats &amp; stem. When I changed the manifold, there was a lot of carbon in the heat crossover, and crud in the lifter valley. Im debating weather to try the Seafoam once more, or just leave it alone &amp; consider myself lucky? 
>>Doug Rodrigues|||Followup-question||| Well, I don't know how many miles is on your engine, but there comes a time in the life of every engine to where it just has to be taken apart and the whole thing boiled-out in a hot tank.  Perhaps your engine's time has come.  Only so much can be done with off-the-shelf &quot;treatments&quot; and mechanics tricks.  Interesting how some engines remain clean all through the years and some get gunked-up?  I suspect that additives such as STP are a major cause of that gunking, since most engine manufacturers say NOT to add anything to the oil.
Of interest and humor:  With airplane engines that have stuck valves because of carbonization....some mechanics do what we call &quot;a Mexican Valve Job.&quot;  The piston in the cylinder with low compression and obvious hissing out the exhaust pipe when the cylinder is pressurized with air at  exactly top dead center confirms the leak.  Someone holds the prop to keep it from kicking-over while the air hose maintains pressure in the cylinder.  The pressure also keeps the valves tightly closed.  The exhaust valve keepers and springs are removed.  The air pressure is relieved.  A 1/2 inch drill is attached to the exhaust valve stem and the valve is spun and pulled into the valve seat.  Any carbon is quickly worn away.  The drill is removed.  The cylinder is again pressurized to maintain the valve in a closed position while the springs and keepers are reinstalled.  In most cases, the compression on that cylinder is raised back up to normal!  Sounds like a backyard mechanic repair, but it works! I even did it on an old airplane I used to own. Never had a problem with low compression after that!  Never tried doing this with an automobile engine though.  I suppose that one could hold a wrench on the crank pulley bolt to keep the engine from turning over.
I forgot to mention:  The above techniques using kerosese or water don't remove sludge from the intake system.  It only removes carbon from the combustion chamber. 
>>ART-O|||Answer||| I've always used old dish soap bottles for this. I have never blown an engine cleaning with water. They usually run like crap for a day or so after cleaning, but there is a definate improvement. I usually just work the throttle by hand and squirt the water in with the other hand. 
>>Doug Rodrigues|||Followup-question||| Yeah, an old dish soap bottle would work perfectly.  Better control than just pouring it out of a cup.  Lets see...with good salesmanship, you could add blue dye to the water, a pepperment smell and label the container &quot;environmentally safe engine decarbonizer.&quot;  That should sell for about $30 a quart?

>>samandiar|||Original question||| I have a 1979 Ford Granada (see sig).  The six I have in there is getting a little tired (184k mi), so I decided I would like to upgrade to a V8.
A 302 sounds best right now, but a 351 will work as well.  I am looking to get around 300hp out of the engine without using a supercharger.  That shouldn't be a problem.  
Also, I want to take out the C4 auto and put in a 5spd manual floor stick.  I hear tremec makes good trannys.
Mainly, what I want to know is:
How expensive will it be to attain 300hp and what mods are best for that?
Can a n00b like me do an engine/tranny swap without a mechanic?
Is it relatively easy to put a 5spd manual in a Granada?
Thanks for the help! 
>>pre98zetec|||Followup-question||| How bout a 390? 
>>ModMech|||Followup-question||| A Granada is very similar to the Fairmont.  They used the 255 V-8 in the Fairmont, so a 302 should fit just fine (afterall, the Fairmont is a &quot;Fox&quot; body as well as the Mustang).
The most difficult part of this is assembling all the bits you'll need to fit everything togather, but anyone who can read a servivce manual, and follow directions *can* do this.  It will not be a quick or easy project.

>>>Title||| Low vacuum
>>waverous|||Original question||| Recently rebuilt a 351W and installed SEFI. When I initially started the engine, I had to rotate plug wires around the cap one spot in order to get the engine to fire. When I attempted to time the engine, I noticed the timing marks were off significantly - about 30 degrees AFTER TDC - not BTDC. Engine ran fine though. Next, I noticed I was only pulling 8&quot; of vacuum. Before buttoning up the engine, I did ensure cam and crank marks lined up on TDC. Any advice on where to start fixing this problem cause I assume they are both related to one another. Thanks for the help 
>>ModMech|||Answer||| The harmonic balancer may be &quot;spun&quot;, causing the timing marks to be WAY off.  You could also have retarded valve timing. 
>>Dan_in_WA|||Followup-question||| I've had this same problem before - what I found is that I hadn't put the distributor in correctly:  Although the crank and cam marks lined up ok, the rotor in the distributor wasn't pointing where the #1 spark plug position was supposed to be.
They'll still run, if you jack enough other stuff out of shape.  Moving ignition wires one 'clock' position, twisting the distributor around, etc.
Been there, done all that.  And still get this one wrong, after having done several engines.    
So, I'd put the #1 cyl. at TDC while making sure that the intake valve has just closed, and see where the distributor rotor points.  Adjust the thing as necessary, until it comes out looking like the manual says it should.
Once you get the timing issues sorted out, I'd be willing to bet that your vaccum readings will come up.
Good luck!

>>Pudnut|||Original question||| Ok this is a really weird problem. But I have a 1990 Ford Bronco that is having this problem with the AC. The problem is this. I turn on the AC while the vehicle is running and the voltmeter drops down to about half. Supposedly this is still in the normal but the truck has trouble starting thereafter. Due to battery drain no doubt. So I was wondering to myself, is this normal? I dont think it is and I feel like it could be a short somewhere in the system? But maybe there's more to it than that. 
>>Dan_in_WA|||Followup-question||| The A/C clutch will certainly put an extra burden on the electrical system, but unless you're blowing fuses or have replaced some fusible links with larger wires, I'd look for something else besides a short circuit.
Does the engine idle speed drop when you turn the A/C on?  Is your alternator putting out enough current?
Does the voltmeter come back up if you rev the engine?
I recommend checking out the alternator/voltage regulator first.
Good luck! 
>>Pudnut|||Followup-question||| The fusible link from the alternator to the solenoid was recently replaced by a mechanic from the local shop so if that is the problem I'll have to be more careful about where I take my truck in the future. But the RPM remains constant and as far as I know the fuses are all working properly but I'll look into it. Thanks for your input.
Also I found out that its not just when the AC is turned on, the heat also causes the meter to drop. And another item to add if this makes  any difference is that I also replaced the positive battery cable with a 4 gauge cable recently. 
>>Dan_in_WA|||Answer||| 
Quote:
>>Pudnut|||Followup-question||| Ok I've had more time to look at the problem. Here is all thats going on. I get the feeling you may be right on the money with this problem. Anytime the vent fans are running or their speed changes the meter drops. Also whenever I operate the front door and rear tailgate power windows it does this as well. My headlights do not work, I just found that out tonight . So if the voltage regulator is dead, and you're probably right. I should buy a new alternator; Correct? I believe my model uses an internal voltage regulator inside the alternator so I would either have to fix the alternator with a kit or buy a new one. 
Thanks so much for the help. 
>>Dan_in_WA|||Answer||| Yes, I'd go with a new alternator.  Get the best quality replacement you can find - the cheap ones will fail within about 18 months (my experience).  A few extra bucks spent now will pay off later.
The store you go to for your new alternator can probably test the old one, just so you know for sure. 
>>Pudnut|||Answer||| I had the alternator tested before the fusible link was replaced. The guy at AutoZone said it was working but I don't know if they just test to make sure its putting out enough electricity or if it tests the voltage regulator as well. But considering that it wasn't doing all of this before the link was replaced I'd have to say that they didn't test the regulator.
Again, thanks for the help. It was very useful advice.

>>dxrflyboy|||Followup-question||| It's OK to use carb cleaner on the EGR valve, but only if you remove it from the engine and you make sure not to get any on the diaphragm or the pintle shaft, which may be coated with a permanent lubricant that the carb cleaner will dissolve.  Do not spray carb cleaner into the intake or on the throttle body.  The throttle body in particular has a teflon coating, which the carb cleaner will also dissolve. 
>>97chevyman|||Answer||| use a good intank cleaner, like seafoam or marvels mystery oil.

>>thepartsyouneed|||Answer||| Turn ignition to RUN or ACC.   Momentarily jump pins in programming connector located behind the glovebox.   The horn will chirp to confirm programming mode.   Press any button on 1st transmitter.   The horn will chirp to confirm programming.   Press any button on 2nd transmitter (up to 4 transmitters possible).   Turn ignition to OFF.   The horn will chirp one last time to indicate end of programming mode.

Does anyone know where I can find a wiring schematic, the ohms it uses so I can check with my meter, or any other info on things to check and how to do it? 
>>dxrflyboy|||Answer||| Try a Haynes manual.  Haynes includes some diagrams.  If you have a friendly local Ford dealer that has a shop manual for the year van you have, they may let you copy diagrams out of it.  Manuals and diagrams are also available to dealers online.  Again, If you find the right dealer, they may download them if your year van is available. 
>>>Title||| rough running mini van
>>dkrace67|||Original question||| We are working on a '96 Windstar that is running rough and has NO power.  Pressing on the gas pedal yields poor throttle response and an acceleration that can be measured in glacial time periods.  At first we suspected a plugged cat, but when we pulled the O2 sensor to investigate we found the cat completely hollow! (that's a completely separate issue I'm curious about).  Regardless, we then turned our attention to the EGR system, so we pulled the intake manifolds (upper and lower), THOROUGHLY cleaned the lower (4 out of 6 EGR passages were plugged with carbon), the gaskets WERE shot, reassembled, flushed the cooling system and have no change.  We've tried a new PCM (junkyard), no change.  Still backfires and has no power.  It has good spark on front three cylinders (13-18kV with 1-5ms burn time), computer does not register any misfires, noid lights say all injectors are working...we're confused!  Next we are going to try a cam position sensor, seems our spark advance is not responding well to engine RPM.  We are stuck at 18 degrees and rarely go above 24.  Any suggestions!??? 
>>ModMech|||Followup-question||| How does it run COLD, for the first 2-3 minutes after start-up?  If it runs OK then, the MAF is either dirty, or bad. 
>>dkrace67|||Answer||| runs the same cold, warm or hot.  MAF looks clean and obstruction free. 
>>dxrflyboy|||Followup-question||| I would suggest a power balance test and maybe a compression test to find which cylinders are dead.  Blown head gaskets are a common problem on the 3.8L engine (not sure if you have the 3.0 or 3.8).  It may have blown between 2 cylinders. 
>>dkrace67|||Answer||| Thanks, we actually got it running.  We cleaned everything and checked numerous sensors etc. and finally brought it to the local shop.  All they did was reset the computer and it ran fine.  Go figure!  We reset the computer SEVERAL times all to no avail, they performed a &quot;hard reset&quot; after looking at it for 6 hours and it started to run fine.  I guess in order to reset the computer, you disconnect the negative battery cable, touch the cable to the positive and reconnect.  Never woulda got that one... 
>>dxrflyboy|||Answer||| I'll have to keep that &quot;hard reset&quot; method in mind.  That's an easy possibility to eliminate early on in my diagnoses - at least the difficult ones!

Separating the lower control arm from the steering knuckle can be difficult sometimes.  If you haven't done it before, your best bet is to have someone assist you who has done this type of work before or take it to a garage. 
>>>Title||| Turn signal synchronizer?
>>ncinirator|||Original question||| I was on E-bay a month or so ago and cant remember how I found this product, and can't find it since. I think it was called a turn signal synchronizer. I remember it showed a picture of a 97 crown vic rear tail light which flashed the left turn signal by right buld to left bulb in the tail light, hence synchronizing the light.
I saw the sync. for mustangs &amp; crown vics only..Anyone ever heard of this?  
>>ncinirator|||Answer||| Found it, they are called sequential signal lights
>>dxrflyboy|||Answer||| I haven't seen sequential turn signals in years!  They were standard on certain Ford/Lincoln/Mercury cars in the late '60s - early '70s.  Each turn signal had 4 or so bulbs.  The signal started by lighting the bulb furthest in, then the next one, and so on until they were all lit.  It looked really cool.  I'm surprised cars with that feature aren't more popular to restore!

My grandfather has a 96 ford van (aerostar) withy 36,000 miles on it that runs great, but the check engine light keeps coming on when the fuel is low. It goes off when he fills it up.
Any idea on what this could be? I don't know much about this van, but sounds like it HAS to be related to the fuel system in some way.
It's a 3 litre V6.
Any input would be greatly appreciated. I posted this in the Aerostar forum, but wanted to get the input of some of you gearheads that may not be aerostar fanatics (how many of those can there possibly be?)  
>>ModMech|||Answer||| Sounds like the in-tank pump died, and it's running only on the main (high pressure) pump.  When the fuel level gets low, the main pump cannot supply enough fuel, and the EEC sees it go lean setting a code.  It would be VERY helpful to get the codes pulled. 
>>§w®øp|||Followup-question||| Yikes! :O
I changed the in-tank pump on a van we used to have...not fun.
So, you're saying there are TWO pumps. Where is the other &quot;main&quot; one then? 
>>cpujunky|||Followup-question||| there isn't, he is wrong.There is only one fuel pump.
It consists of a strainer/a float(level indicator)and the pump.
The pump either works or it doesn't.
I know the engine, ford used it in the tempo/topaz line in 92/93/94.
The best thing to do is pull the codes and find out what the computer says.
Do that then you can stop guessing and start looking at things the computer tells you. 
>>amac209|||Answer||| i bet the codes have something to do with the evap system. theres probably a pinched or partially clogged hose to the evap test crap and if the tank doesn't enough vacuum after a certain amount of time it sets a code and turns on the CEL. pull the codes... autozone will do it for free 
>>§w®øp|||Followup-question||| I did not know that. Is that national? I never knew they even did it. I'll call them this morning. Thanks!

I've looked at it.  The oil is clean, the engine cranks over, I pulled the valve cover (single cam 2.0 motor) and watched the rockers move, so the timing belt isn't broken.  Engine will not fire up, even a little bit.  She said it just plain quit running all of a sudden.

No spark then back track till you find the coil or ignition control modual.

>>LTD Flivver|||Original question||| I recently bought a '71 LTD convertible w/ a 351w.  The wiring under the hood is a complete mess.  There were 2 starter solenoids right next to each other when I got it.  Looks like they also did a distributor conversion and added an ignition module.
I removed one of the solenoids, cleaned up the wiring and got it running.
However, I've now blown up 3 ignition modules.  Doesn't really surprise me when I see the mess under the hood, but does anyone have any suggestions???  
I've inspected the wiring at the module, to the coil, to the distributor, and to the firewall (heading towards ignition switch).  It all looks good.  What causes an ignition module to fry??
Any ideers would be appreciated.  Thanks. 
>>Mercracer|||Followup-question||| Start out with a fresh harness from a newer donor car.  It is very simple to do the conversion properly.  All you need is the harness from the distributor to the coil and to the module.  The original coil + wire goes to the coil +,and you run one of the ignition positive wires to the coil positive, and the other ignition module positive wire to the ignition post on your starter solenoid.  I don't recall which color goes to the coil, and which to the solenoid off the top of my head. 
>>amac209|||Followup-question||| what type of ignition does it have??? duraspark?? i can't post the diagram here but i could e-mail it to you if you want. sounds like the balast resistor has been bypassed the red wire from the module should have a ballast resistor before it goes to the coil(+) there should also be a start bypass wire on the coil side of the resistor. the green wire should go to coil(-). hope this helps you

1. remove large axle nut 1 1/4&quot; socket(i think). this is easier if someones standing on the brakes.
2. jack up car&amp; suport on jackstand or blocks at front crossmember or lifting point on body(not under control arm)
3. remove brake caliper, hang with bungee cord
4. remove outer tie rod bolt&amp; seperate tie rod from spindle(a sharp hammer tap does this nicely just don't damage the threads.
5. remove steering knuckle(ball joint) bolt.
6. seperate steering knuckle from spindle. this usually involves a really big prybar and cursing.
If you hammer a flat punch into the split on the spindle and lube it up good they'll usually come apart without too much dificulty. i don't recomend using a &quot;Pickle fork&quot; unless you're replacing the balljoint too because they damage the grease seal.
7. tap wheel end on axle through bearing while pulling spindle outwards(theres just enough room for it to slip out.
8. pry out the transaxle side of axle with large screw driver or prybar, make sure snapring is on the end when it comes out or you'll have to go fishing for it. 
9. i'd recomend replacing the transaxle seal at this point.
10. lube transaxle side of new axle with atf before installing it. if you got this far you should be able to get everything back together. torque axle nut to 100-120 ft-lb(should verify this might be different for your car). another thing you might need do is squeeze the tie rod against the spindle with some big pliers or visegrips while tightning because they have a tendency to spin.

Elactronic ignition that's YEARS(literally) better than any Duraspark.Also has a settable rev limiter!!!Keeps the thing looking stock and works fantastic!!
 Just put one in my Galaxie 500XL 390 convertible a while back.Simply amazing the difference it made.Faster starts more midrange and top end power,smoother and gets better mileage too.Went up almost 2.5 mpg in daily driving.Thing costs $100 Canadian and installs in ten minutes.

I'm a novice but here's how mine is done and my trust Chilton's books seems to agree:
Plug 1 (2 wires)
- Red &amp; white go back to the ignition (red feeds power when running, white when cranking)
Plug 2 (4 wires)
- Green carriers current from the coil to module
- Black is ground between distributor and module
- Purple &amp; Orange to distributor
Hope this helps.

That's pretty much it in a nut shell.  There are still plenty of

>>>Title||| 65' Ford Custom 500 Question
>>Gerby|||Original question||| I recently acquired a 1965 Ford Custom 500 (four door, green and white for those who want to know), that has a disassembled engine.
However I'm certain the engine is not the original as it has a 300 Inline Six. I was wondering if anyone knew of any other Fords from that era that had 300 Inlines and how hard it is to find parts and what not for them. 
>>ervinj|||Answer||| inline six's were very common in the sixty's and you shouldn't have trouble with the parts.
ervinj 
>>g.simonson|||Answer||| The original six in a fullsize '65 Ford would have been 240 ci.  Just a smaller displacement version of the 300 that you now have... should be a lot of interchangeable parts there.

>>billgerat|||Original question||| I have a '78 Fairmont with the v-6 3.3 liter engine. I need to get the emission pipe that runs from the bottom base of the carburator to the back top of the engine. I am going junkyard hunting, and am curious of what other Ford models used the v-6 3.3 liter engine (L6 200 3.3 liter)? 
>>ModMech|||Answer||| It's an I-6 200 CID.  The small '80s LTDs, Early Mustangs and Mavericks (140 CID, same basic engine).
Other than those, nothing I can think of.
-edited becaue I can't hit the right keys. 
>>DeanTheImp|||Answer||| Ford also sold the 200 cid industrial engine for use in farm and industrial equipment. I have a neighbor that has a 200 cid industrial engine in his Owattona Windrower. I looked it over and I it looks exactly like the 200 in my 70 Maverick. 
>>FoxGranadaChuck|||Answer||| Ford Fox Bodies with the 200ci I-6 are fairly plentiful in wrecking yards, at least those here in my home of Northeast Tennessee.

I'd like to go with a 351, just because 5.8 is bigger than 5.7 :-D  
Should I build up an engine or find a running one and modefy it ?  (possibley an engine from a crown vic ?) 
Decent gas mileage would be nice because of daily driver, and of course dependability.  
I'd like to make 350-375 hp naturally aspirated and off pump gas.  
Jeese I want alot, huh ?  
To cut it down, I just want some info on reliable engines to build up and decently priced mods (should I go increased compression ratio, overbore the cylinders, cam, heads etc) to do to them.

Also, would  it be possible to install a hemi engine or a 12 cylinder. Because I heard that there was enough room underneath the hood to put a 12 cyilnder in there but i dont know? 
>>GTR2b|||Answer||| Not unless you cut out the fenderwells and relocated the shock towers.  The you may have to relocate the steering rack, move the radiator forward, and possibly cut away from the firewall.
Basically, a '70 Mav has a very tiny engine compartment and I would seriously discourage this swap.
A buddy of mine and I thought it would be funny to throw a 351C in a Mav that we had sitting around our shop.  The project got less and less funny the more that we had to modify the chassis to make it fit.  A week later we got it in but the car didn't handle the extra weight well.

If you would press on the gas the pressure would go up, but would fall back of when you let up. I replaced the oil pressure sending unit and it didn't help. So I replaced the oil pump. It is still losing pressure. This think is driving me crazy. Talked to my dad and he said try and replace the oil pump drive shaft, but I don't think it will help. Does anyone have any suggestions. Also it has a automatic transmision. And the engine was rebuilt 2 years ago. 
P.S. I'm using the stock gauge and the engine only has about 30,000 on the rebuild.

>>ModMech|||Followup-question||| I hate to tell you this, but you DO NOT have an &quot;oil pressure gauge&quot;.  Your truck has what is called an &quot;idiot gauge&quot;.  Either it has oil pressure, or it doesn't.  The &quot;sender&quot; is not really a sender at all, but a on/off switch.  That's right, a switch.  When it's &quot;on&quot; the gauge shows &quot;normal&quot; oil pressure, usually about &quot;O&quot; to &quot;R&quot; in NORMAL, when the switch is &quot;off&quot; it shows nothing (needle to far left).  I would first suspect a bad switch, they are a known problem.  It would be a good idea to get a mechanical gauge on it to check the REAL oil pressure too.
Don't be too worried, it is common for the oil pressure to drop as it warms, and in your case it's VERY likely that the sender is malfunctioning and showing the pressure is lower than it really is.

>>vbrpete|||Followup-question||| Clean out the throttle body.The back of the blade is probly sludged up badly(very common to all cars).Remove it,lay it face down on a rag and pour in some ATF.(don't use carb cleaner-wrecks the seals).Let it sit,then clean it out with an old toothbrush.Also clean out the IAC,or idle air control solenoid on the side of the throttle body.Remove it,disassemble the top from bottom with the two phillips screws and the clean the OPEN PART WITH TWO HOLES with throttle body cleaner or carb cleaner.Just don't get the top(motor) end full of fluid,it'll trash it.
 Other stuff to check-vacuum leaks,dirty air filter,fuel pressure(changed the filter recently?),and even the transmission fluid and condition.If it's brown,or smells burnt,then it could be the trans that's causing the problems.If these quick fixes don't do it,get it checked professionally as it could be a bigger problem like a head gasket etc.

THANKS!!! 
>>ervinj|||Answer||| first you must have your vehicle in a warm enviornment, above freezing .Spray some brake cleaner into the cylinder (be careful not to allow the cleaner to come in contact with your paint job). After a few minutes, get some dry graphite (from a hobby store) squirt it into the keyhole . Put your key in and work it back and forth. repeat several times (The grafite part not the cleaning) and it should take care of the symptom but the problem is probably water entering the tumble set.

>>nates6969|||Original question||| Hi I have a mercury topaz V6 and lately the check engine light has been always on, turns on about 10 seconds after starting. It started happening after a vaccuum line got disconected off the EGR. I reattached the line but still the light comes on. Also nonw when you start it up it revs up to about 1200 then drops to 200 then usually goes back up to steady idle but sometimes it stalls or it idles up and down from 1500 to 500 and back and forth. Could this be a problem with the EGR? and if it is would it be the valve or solinoid? If you could help me out that would be great!  also if I were to get it plugged into a computer would it tell me which is shot or would it give me one basic code? Thanks

I had numerous error codes corrected including a 1443 to get the truck to pass the Tenn emissions I went to my local shop for some and the dealer to get the 1443 fixed.  All this was very costly especially since the truck drove fine for the 4 years, the light was on and all I got was a bunch of sensors replaced.  For the past 4 years the truck always passed emissions in Denver which uses a sniffer instead of here in Nashville which checks the obdc2 for errors.  The light stayed off for about 300 miles of normal mixed highway/ city driving, no more than 20 miles of this driving at stretch.  After about 45 minutes of highway speed ~70 mph the light came on.   I figured the computer ran a test that it had not run before and found the 'error'
I plan on going down to parts store to have the code read but I wonder if anyone has any ideas, and if I have the same error codes coming back as before what kind of responsibility the dealer has to make it right.

>>flytomcats|||Followup-question||| To all,
I have a 98 expedition EB, 77k, 5.4 motor. I was recently on a trip and got the check engine light, flashing, after going over Donner pass, 7,000ft or so. Had the wife look it up and it talked about possible misfire or something with the catlytic converter. The expi was running ok at the time I thought. After about 15 min the light would go off for a min or so and then would come back. Then it would go on steady. Of course the book says steady could be the gas cap not on tight, etc. After about 20 min I noticed the expi running rough and could feel the misfire, especially between 1500 and 2000 rpm. We were only three hrs into a 7 hour trip so we stopped in Sacramento and holed up for the night since it was Sun and no garages open. I did as much research on the web and armed myself with as much knowledge about the light. I want to say thanks to all who have posted before me, you really helped! In my research I found the following possibilities:
1)If the engine is running rough and smokey exhaust, fuel injector stuck open pouring too much gas in 
2)Possible fuel filter dirty or problem with (?)fuel neck
3)Oxygen sensor, water or fuel dripping on it possibly messing with mixture(cold weather and water unfreezing or lots o'rain
4)EGR sensor(ExhaustGasRecirculation) or valve. Related is the DPFE or differential pressure sensor related to EGR operation
5)Fuel tank pressure sensor
6)water in the spark plug
7)a blown fuse
9)Idle Air Control valve or IAC
11)loose gas cap
After checking the OBD or on-board diagnostic code we got a P0304 which is #4 cylinder misfire, i.e. #10. Changed both the spark plug and the coil and all was well. Finished the last 500 miles without a hitch. In a lot of postings Autozone was talked about as being able to read your OBD codes for free. This turned out NOT to be the case at the one autozone I tried. The employee said they weren't allowed to read them in California. Not sure how wide spread this is but you supposedly can buy one on ebay for approx $45. I think the coil was the prob, the spark plug looked ok but the coils are advertised to 100k miles, 77k was close. I would recommend calling autozone or other parts stores or garages to see if they will read the code for free. The coil and plug were about 100 bucks plus an hour of labor and change for $184 total. Add in the 116 hotel bill and I got out of it pretty good. I hope this info helps someone else out, I've now read too many &quot;check engine&quot; light horror stories. BTW Bob's Auto Service in Elk Grove, CA did a great job, they specialize w/Ford.

Monetary breaks in closed circuits is like turning off/on a switch hundreds of times while driving also, make sure the headlamp housing is not loose, if it is, it's shaking the element causing it to break.
I've run into this on older vehicles. Hope this is helpful, Let us know what's up.
ervinj 
>>mtdxx|||Followup-question||| yo ervinj I've had a chance to drive the car and get more familiar with what is going on.  
The car is having power surges where the headlights will brighten, the radio goes out for a second or 2, and something has been done to the air bag system,  The air bag light is on.  The car also loses power.  
The surges happen while driving.    I hooked a meter up while I was driving.  THe surges have reached 18.7V at times.  But most of the time the alternator is putting out 14.5 or so.       Voltage regulator maybe?    I read that it could be the connection at the plug.     
Tried to check that, but it got too involved, the whole alternator has to come off to get to the plug  
Let me know what you may think of this, thanks! 
>>ervinj|||Followup-question||| Yea, sounds like the connection could be bad or as you guessed, the regulator, Most newer alternators have the regulator built in so, If it's obtaining voltages as high as you recorded, It is safe to say the problem is somewhere in the alternator. check those connections and since the alternator is off anyway have it checked. Make sure the highbeam light is tight in the socket (no rattling around).
ervinj 
>>mtdxx|||Answer||| Thanks for the advice.  After the alternator problem is resolved, then I get to worry about the air bag.

>>ehce|||Original question||| just bought a '95 aerostar w/ 94,000 miles on it.  The cruise control surges slightly when set above around 55 mph.  Nothing big, it seems to hold speed fine, but is on/off throttle pretty often and less gradual than other vehicles I have driven.  I have an '82 E-250, a '94 Civic and a '90 Aerostar that all operate more smoothly than this one.  
I changed the cap &amp; rotor, plugs &amp; wires, and the air filter.  I also cleaned the throttle body and mass flow sensor and disconnected the negative battery cable overnight to clear the CPU.  all this led to a slight improvement but the problem is still there.
I used a code scanner and no problem codes came up.

>>CeeJay|||Original question||| At about 2 this morning I decided to try and tidy up a storage space in our kitchen. Don’t ask me what possessed me to do this at 2 in the morning ( sign of insanity perhaps ), but in doing so I found quite a few pieces of Ford literature which maybe, members of this site might be interested in.
I haven’t placed prices by any of this stuff so if any of you would like to purchase some of the following, please just make an offer on what you want.
I haven’t described any of these pieces in detail either, as I hadn’t intended advertising them anywhere, so, if you’d like more information on any of the items please just ask.
The photographs show many of the items as having yellow edges in places. I can only guess that this has happened as a result of my scanner –  of these pieces have yellow edges I can assure you.
First of all I have issues number 1 through to 10 of a magazine called “Ford Heritage”. This magazine first appeared early in 1993, and because these are not copies that I purchased to read, none have been opened and are in the exact same condition they were the day I first bought them.
The following are a selection of Ford sales literature from the UK.
Apologies for not including full and detailed descriptions of these items. If anyone requires further information, please let me know. All of the items are unpriced and open to offers.

>>>Title||| Oil pan gasket leak
>>JJRam|||Original question||| I have a '95 e150 van with a 4.9 straight 6.  There is a small piece of oil pan gasket (about an inch long) missing from the right side near the rear of the engine. I have been told, by my oil change tech, that this is common for that engine.
Anyone have any info on this?  similar experience, any recalls, causes, fixes, etc?
I thought I had a bad main bearing seal, as it was dripping from the fly-wheel, until I found the hole.
I had gotten estimates from $500 - $800 to replace the gasket (have to pull engine, evidently), so I cleaned the hole and plugged it with silicone about a year ago, which took care of the leak.  Just started leaking again.
Guess I'll do the same again if there is no other reasonably cheap fix.
Curious
Jeff 
>>ervinj|||Answer||| you don't have to pull the engine but it is a pain in the rear to change the gasket. If you have any knowledge of engines you should be able to remove the motor mount bolts , jack the engine drop (as far as you can the pan, clean the old gasket off , glue the new on the block and replace
the pan and so forth. 800 would be way out of the question and the 500 is too high for my area.

>>sladezero|||Original question||| Hey there,
I was curious, I will be changin tranny fluid in my tempo.
Is the MERCON V downward compatible with MERCON ?
If so do I have to worry about the yellow metals with the GL-4
gear spec?
Slade 
>>kbro|||Answer||| 
Quote:
>>proticus|||Followup-question||| there is an additive that you can throw in with the mercon to make it just as good as mercon V.  I'm not sure how much it costs, and for the life of me i can't remember what it was called.  maybe lube guard?  don't quote me on that, i'm not certain if i remember right. 
>>proticus|||Followup-question||| just reread your post sladezero, i didn't even catch the part about the gl-4.  do you have a manual transmission?  if so, why would you have mercon in it?  it's way too thin.  but i'm probably just misunderstanding. 
>>sladezero|||Followup-question||| Hey there,
I was thinking the same thing too.  That is until I called the dealership
and they said to use MERCON/DEXRON III ATF.  The link below also 
recommends this stuff as well.  The manual tranny is at the bottom.
I went ahead and got a synthetic blend.  I'll most likely run it for a 
couple of weeks and check it.  If it's good I'll run it for about 3-6months
and change.  If it works good I might move onto a synthetic.
Of course if the Pennzoil Synthetic blend works well why switch right ?
I am not choosy.  If it works why change and risk it.
BTW- for those of you new to this as I am the MTX was said by the
dealership to hold 6.2pints or 3.1Quarts (Same thing).
Hope this helps to explain it a little.
Slade 
>>proticus|||Followup-question||| it just doesn't seem to make sense in my head to put something that thin into a gear box.  the mercon/dexron was made specifically as thin as it was because it had to be so thin for the slushboxes(automatic transmissions).  the mercon is moving very quickly through an automatic transmission.  that's why it's so thin.  it just doesn't make sense in my head to put it in a manual transmission.  but maybe they're right.  although, i would definitely call a couple more places and get a 3rd and 4th opinion.  i might recall having put mercon in ford manual transmissions before, but it was a while ago, and i might be confusing it with another vehicle's transfer box.  i don't remember.  but i would definitely get that 3rd and 4th opinion.  or in fact, just open the plug on your tranny and see what's all ready in it.  good luck 
>>>Title||| Engine stalls at 55 MPH
>>lrac|||Original question||| While driving a '91 Tempo on the highway it suddenly stalled. It would not restart. Towed it in and left it sitting for a week. Decided to try it again and it fired right off but stalled after 10 seconds. Again, it would not restart. I heard the fuel pump in the rear of the car during ignition on/off so I don't think it's the pump. When cranking the engine it sounds like it's not firing. So I think it's an electrical problem but can't pinpoint it. Does anybody know what it could be? 
>>lrac|||Followup-question||| I discovered the coil wasn't putting out spark so I installed a new one.  It started up fine and run for several minutes before quitting just like when you turn the key off.  Of course it will not restart. And the new coil is not putting out fire. Could the new coil be bad or is something zapping it?

>>DaGr8Tim|||Answer||| Yes and no.
The vulcan in the tempo was not totally the same as the vulcan in the Taurus/Sable.  I know several of the accessories had different brackets so the engine would fit in a Tempo engine bay.
So the block may fit, but you may need to swap some accessories around.
Not to mention that all of the electronics for the engine including the computer and wiring harness will have to be swapped.  Also, the tranny are probably not interchangable because I believe the sable tranny is computer controled.

>>evopanop|||Answer||| Well, even if they did add it, it wouldn't be under the Ford section anyway. Even though the Pantera uses some Ford 'bits, namely the powertrain, it isn't a Ford. It's called the De Tomaso Pantera.  
>>VenomInMyVeins|||Followup-question||| I know it's de tomaso, but they don't even have a section for de tomaso, so the next likely place I would assume would be on a ford forum, right?  basically all the innards minus exhaust intake and tranny are ford.  Plus when they were being marketed, they were being sold at ford lincoln mercury dealers...  and to this day I still hear it called a ford pantera every once in a while.  I know it's not truely a ford, but it's as close to american muscle as an italian exotica can get.

>>>Title||| Engine upgrades
>>Crownman|||Original question||| I have a 85 vic and i wanna make it move a little faster.(I know its a heavy car so i can only expect so much outta it at the same time) Right now shes pretty good but since its a 5.0L and I know theres alot of ways to get some more power outta it. 
I was thinking of gettin a 4v intake and carb to start off with and then going from 2'' duals to 2.5 or 3''(depending on which is best)
Would it be possible to take the cam out of an 85 stang, and if so is this going to help me much?
If i do these upgrades how is the transmission and rear end going to hold up. I know these mods wont add any serious power but im also taking the age of these components into mind.

Plus see the poll of what American Fords should be sold in the UK 
>>Hudson</span>|||Followup-question||| Taurus to replace the Mondeo? Crown Victoria to replace the Sierra? You have never seen these cars?
First, the Mondeo replaced the Sierra. Second, the Taurus is bigger than the Mondeo and the Crown Victoria is CONSIDERABLY larger than the Sierra. I don't see the comparison here.
Additionally, the Freestar is too large for European markets.

>>bigaldover|||Original question||| My dad has an 93 Topaz with3.0 V6 and auto.  Over 206000KM motor seems in good shape.  Iwill be changing the gas tank, as it is leaking now.  How do you remove the quick disconnect fittings ?
The gas lines are rusty and I do not want to put any extra stress on them.  I have de-pressurized the lines using the shut off switch.
Any help on this woul be greatly apprectaited.
Secondly, when starting the car in the morning it is hard to start and if you step on the gas it will almost stall.  Plugs, rotor and wires have been changed.  This has been slowly getting worse.  
I am wondering is this possibly a cam / valve problem ?
Any ideas on things to check and test ?

>>klnaco|||Original question||| I have a 1990 Taurus Wagon that has been sitting for nearly two years due to it having transission problems (wouldn't get out of first gear). The engine was replaced and only has ~ 40k miles on it, which is why I did not get rid of it immediately.
Recently, a dealership told me about the BG Flush procedure which has been relatively successful in correcting minor transmission problems at for ~$125.
For a vehicle that has been sitting so long, are there any key steps I need to consider toget this running? (BTW -I have been able to start it up. I let it run for a few minutes to allow the fluids to circulate and oil to spreadsome)
Also, has anyone had any luck with this procedure?

>>>Title||| starter relay problem
>>DreamsofaCobra|||Original question||| I have an '89 Thunderbird (3.8L) with a lot of problems. One of them is inconsistant starting (engine turns, but will not fire). But the problem I am dealing with now is my starter relay is making a clicking sound, but not running the starter motor. I tested it, and it is getting 12-14 volts from the ignition switch, and it seems to work outside of the car. (solid click) 
Anyone had this problem? It isn't a bad ground. 
The first time it happened I replaced the relay with an off-brand replacment. It worked for a while, then got stuck open. I had to disconnect the battery to stop the starter motor. I threw the original relay in to start the car and it has worked up until now. Could my starter motor be pulling too much current, droping the voltage through the rest of the circuit, and melting the off-brand relay? I don't want to keep throwing relays at the problem.
Thanks, 
Matt 
>>Trigger351|||Followup-question||| Sounds like the starter motor has worn bushes which cause it to pole and draw too much current that can weld the solenoid shut and kill the battery.

Cycle Ignition from OFF to RUN 8 times within 10 seconds, ending in RUN. All doors will lock then unlock to confirm programming mode. Press any button on 1st remote transmitter. Door locks will cycle to confirm programming. Press any button on 2nd transmitter ( up to 4 transmitters total possible ). Turn ignition to OFF.

It has a real bad idle surge . I have replaced the tab the egr and sensor and the ics no luck. I feel like I am throwing money in the gas tank for no good reason. If I disconect the egr vacum line the idle jumps up to 2000 but smooths out. If I disconect the tab connector it smooths out but I have to hold the throttle part way open or it stalls. Help I am running outa money to throw at it. 
>>pcv|||Answer||| Look for a vacuum leak and /or a switched vacuum line. Look for a vacuum diagram on the radiator shroud and check connections. Make sure the intake is not leaking. Good Luck. 
>>Unit 5302|||Original question||| Definately look at the BAP sensor vacuum line.
Does the car buck and surge down the road, and does it run well at WOT?  Definately sounds like a vacuum problem.
Another way to test it is to fire the car up, let it idle, if you can and open a propane torch, just the gas but don't light it.  Move it around the engine compartment slowly near vacuum lines and what not.  If the engine repeatedly revvs when you hold it at a certain point, you probably have discovered a leak.

>>BobFalfa|||Original question||| is there a cheap and safe way to give my truck (V6) an awsome, throaty sound?  improving performance is not a must 
>>HillbilySailor|||Answer||| A good aftermarket exhaust should give you the sound you're looking for.  Flowmaster and Borla are two good places to start. 
>>HiFlow5 0</span>|||Answer||| Well, don't expect too much for a loud deep rumble like a V8. Flowmasters sound like crap IMO, especially on a V6. Borla way over priced!!! Dynomax are nice, and Magnaflow makes a pretty good sounding muffler! 
>>Dan_in_WA|||Answer||| A good set of headers will do wonders.  If they're not available for your engine/chassis combination, go to  and you can get all the parts you need to build your own. 
>>HillbilySailor|||Answer||| Dynomax and Magnaflow are good choices also.  If it was me, I'd ditch the V-6 and put a 351 Windsor in. 
>>BobFalfa|||Followup-question||| thanks. does anyone know if Gibson is a good brand? 
>>SniperX13|||Answer||| I had a gibson cat back on my 99 ranger 4x4 with a 3.0L v6.  It had a really nice mellow rumble to it, but once you got up above 35/40, you couldnt hear it anymore.
>>PAracer|||Answer||| With a v6 you will have trouble eliminating the rasp that a high flow setup will give you.  If youuse a resonator or two before the muffler, you will get rid of some of the rasp.  IMO intake mods improve sound better than exhaust mods on small engines. 
>>99silverGT|||Followup-question||| i had a 94 4.0 ranger with a 3.5&quot; dual exhaust with no mufflers. it sounded great IMO. i left the converters on it to muffle it somewhat. i now have a 93 4.0 ranger with only one converter and 3.5&quot; exhaust with one 40 series flowmaster. it sounds better than the 94 because it has a good rumble at all RPMs. the one with no mufflers sounded like it was missing at idle but was louder. 
>>>Title||| 89  bronco ii problems
>>Bellis|||Original question||| I have a 1989 bronco ii and it has problems running.
Usually it will start right up. But after I drive around for 5 minutes or so and I let up off the gas. It just suddenly dies. And I was at McDonalds the other night and I had to keep my foot on the gas at the drive through so it wouldn't die. But after waiting for 10 minutes it died anyways. And then I have to wait roughly an hour before it will start up again after that. 
I just got the battery replaced today and it's still doing the same thing.
Any idea what the problem could be.? 
>>pcv|||Answer||| How does the vehicle idle after you start and run for 5 minutes. Does it run rough or just idles low. If it runs rough, you might have a tune up related problem. If it idles low, you will need the idle control valve cleaned and even replaced. Good Luck. 
>>Bellis|||Followup-question||| it idles low. would the idle control valve cause the vehicle to just stop running once I take my foot of the gas? and when it begins to die it sounsd as if the vehicle is running out of gas.

How much fuel is remaining in the tank?  It will have to be drained;  you may be able to do this yourself by disconnecting the fuel return hose, attaching another line, and running the pump.  Put the old gas in an approved container!  It will still burn!  Just not well enough to run an engine.

>>beigecar|||Original question||| My 92 Ford Tempo alwasy shakes to die when it runs while the brake is pressed, i.e. while you backward parking, after pressing the brake for 20 second, it starts shaking and seems to die. But if i stop, and give it some gas, it becomes ok again. Does anyone have any idea for this problem, thank you in advance. 
>>Dan_in_WA|||Followup-question||| First, do your brake lights work?  Ford has a &quot;BOO&quot; switch that won't signal the EEC unless the lights are good.  The bulbs are acually the ground path for the circuit.  &quot;BOO&quot; stands for Brake On/Off.  Can't remember if you're car has this or not.
Try visiting us at  
The site will be back up early this week.  It is down for maintenance right now.
The absolute, very first thing to do when troubleshooting these cars is to read any codes stored in the EEC-IV.
Check to make sure your SES light will come on.  When you first turn the key, all the dash lights illuminate - and the SES light should work as well.  If this is ok, all you'll need is a short jumper wire, and you'll be reading codes.  More on this later.

>>Billy Markham|||Answer||| My problem is that myTempo starts, then dies promptly.  I crank it up and it always starts again (so far), but it sounds like it wants to die every time I pull up to a red light.  I was told there might be a leak in a vacuum hose attached to the intake manifold. 
>>pcv|||Answer||| If you have a vacuum leak, you will hear a hissing noise, like air escaping. Follow it and replace or repair the hose. Even with the engine off, follow all the vacuum hoses and make sure they ar not leaking.
Onother thing you need to look at is the ignition coil tower. Take the ignition wire off and clean the terminal. They get really corroded and can cause you problem.

>>Riger|||Original question||| Hello All
I have a 1992 Ford Grand Marq, great shape and never any real problems until now.
A day or 2 ago the wipers had stopped working for no reason, checked fuse and it was fine, went to a garage thinking it was a wiper motor and was advised it was not but that it could be the &quot;Switch&quot; but I would have to go elsewhere because they were concerned with deploying the airbag and costing more money, the newest garage (2nd) has now said it's not the switch but they have no idea what it is and want to continue to trouble shoot further, which is fine unless I am being a fool but it really does need fixing.
Has ANYONE else come across this type of problem in the past (wipers stop working and fuse, wiper motor are fine) and what did the issue turn out to be?  I am not really knoweledgable about cars but would this have a govener or some type in it perhaps getting in the way??
Input is very welcome!

I am doing a build on a 1932 Ford 3-window coupe and have been hunting high and low for wiring and plumbing schematics, I was wondering if anyone could tell me a site that has some on it, just something to give me a good place to start.
For the most part I have all the wiring figured out, it is the brake lines and stuff like that I am not certain how/where to run it along the frame.
Any tips/ideas would be greatfully accepted.
Thanks all

>>>Title||| New Ford Models!!!!
>>fordmustang23|||Answer||| The new F150 will come out soon. I am more excited about the Futura and Five Hundred that will replace the Taurus. The Futura will come standard with a inline 4cyl at 170hp and the Five Hundred will come stock with a v6 at 220hp. The v6 can also be obtained in the Futura. The Five Hundred is available in an auto tranny or a CVT. The futura is available in a Cvt or several auto and manual trannys. The new ford focus will have a 2.4 liter and more agressive looks that will make it a strong competitor with the civic. 
>>Hudson</span>|||Original question||| The Focus will have a 2.3L DOHC engine (not 2.4L) nationwide shortly. The engine is already offered in California. An all-new Focus is not due out (in North America) until late in this decade.
The Futura is based on the Mazda6, just like the upcoming Mercury and Lincoln versions. The Ford Five Hundred, Ford Freestyle, and Mercury sedan are all to be based (roughly) on the senior Volvo platform which is the basis of the S60, V70, XC70, S80, and XC90. 
>>fordmustang23|||Followup-question||| I like mid-size cars and when my Stang turns to crap I'm going to buy a Futura one or two years old. I admit they aren't the best lookin cars but I don't like the cramped feeling of compacts and you have to admit that a Futura with a turbocharger and performance parts would be one hell of a sleeper.  
The Focus will be redesigned on a global platform shared with Mazda and Volvo for release in 2005 that and the bigger engine and redesign should definetly help the focus with the lofty goal of competing with the civic. 
>>Hudson</span>|||Answer||| 
Quote:
>>freakray</span>|||Answer||| An AWD Focus is nothing phenomenal or new....see Europe.....RS Cosworth.
I think if Ford want to compete with the Civic, they need to improve the quality of the Focus rather than give it a bigger engine.
The most the US market can hope for is the European style updated headlights, like Hudon said, there won't be a redesign for a couple of years.

>>Euro19|||Original question||| We all know the actual Taurus will be redesigned sometimes this year or so. Here is a pic of what it could be, in a GT version, based on the australian Ford. 
>>Hudson</span>|||Followup-question||| The Taurus will be replaced, not redesigned. It will be replaced by the Ford Five Hundred sedan and Ford Freestyle SUV-like wagon next year and the Ford Futura sedan in 2005. None of which will be RWD or based on anything Australian.
The Five Hundred and Freestyle are loosely based on the Volvo P2X platform which is the basis of the senior Volvo models (S60, V70, XC70, S80, XC90). The Futura will be based on the Mazda6/Atenza, which are loosely derived from the Ford Mondeo. All models will be FWD with AWD offered.

>>richn95136|||Original question||| I was wondering if anyone can please help! I have a 1995 Lumina 3.1. When it is park and I press the gas the car seems to run OK. But when I put the car into gear and accelerate there is hesitation/stumbling/surging thoughout the entire driving range thereafter....At the same time there is this dreadful whistling noise which starts when after I put the car in gear and have driven a mile or two and the engine is heated up....The noise is REALLY loud. The whistling/skreeching starts as one high pitched sound, then another whistle in a different octave, then another in a different octave, etc. until there are 3 or 4 whistles simualtaneosly....the faster I try to go, the louder the whistles, the more hesitation/stumbling, the less engine power I have.....It almost sounds like some kind of obstruction in the fuel injection, a faulty EGR valve or an intake manifold leak.  The funny thing is, after I have driven it to the point of whistling and put the car in park there is no hesitation or stumbling when I step on the accelerator, and I have to go to a very high RPM to get the noise to start when it is in park.....PLEASE HELP! 
>>Fritz The Cat|||Followup-question||| Sounds like a vacume leak. Take a look at the vacume hoses, see if there is a plug with 3 or 4 hoses somewhere that is disconnected. I think on your engine it's right on top, near the throttle body.

>>>Title||| Ford Festiva - Battery Problems
>>Phades|||Original question||| I have a 1988 Ford Festiva.  Had this thing for a long long time.  Got it for $400 with only 40k miles.  It now has 106k miles.
I haven't had any problems with the car and I do all the maintenance on it myself.
Here's the problem.  I left the lights on killed the battery.  Tried to jump the car and it wouldn't stay on for more than a few mins.  I thought it was the battery, so I replaced the battery since getting a jump from someone else would get it to turn on....otherwise I would have no power.
I got a new battery and installed it.  Was talking on my cell phone at the same time and accidently connected the terminals backwards.  Connect the positive to the neg and neg to positive on the battery.  As soon as I did that, a wire near the battery in a box with 3 wires looping over (the middle wire which is the one that i'm reffering to had a label saying &quot;Main&quot;) LIT UP like a 100watt light bulb.  I immediately disconnected the terminals realizing what I had just done.
That wire in the middle got so hot that it burnt out.  The box with that wire and the other 2 wires can be traced down to a few different sections under the hood--mainly the positive terminal that connects to the battery and every place that connects to.
Anyhow, after that happened I notice the belt on the Alternator was broken.  This was the original problem that caused the dead battery.  My alternator was not running and recharging the batter--thus dead battery.  Anywho, I replaced the wire in the box that got burned out as well as the alternator belt.  I figured this would fix everything.  I was wrong.  The new battery after that only lasted about a week.  I replaced the battery again and figured I might have fried the alternator somehow.  A neighboor junked his festiva a few years back and I salvaged a lot of parts from it, including the alternator.  I replaced the alternator with this one.
I went to Pep Boys and had them test the new battery and alternator.  All tests were good.  However, this next battery only lasted 3 weeks.  It slowly looses a charge and while driving all the lights go dim in the car, the radio loses power, the headlights go real dim... It seems as there isn't sufficient power to run these things and then the battery goes dead and not enough power to start the car.
The car drains more power than it puts back into the battery.
I noticed one weird thing.  Everytime the car is on, If i rev the engine or drive for awhile, then get out of the car and touch the frame while standing outside the car I get a BIG SHOCK.. EVERYTIME I do it.
Seems as the frame of the car is getting charged somehow... Not sure if that is a side affect of the problem or related in anyway at all to the problem.   On a good note, now I have a shocking personality and get charged while in the car and give most people within the few minutes of leaving my car a nice good shock on contact =D
Any help in trying to find out what's causing the problem would be much appreciated.  New battery just installed and I guess I have about a week or 2 before this one is dead also...
Sidenotes:
Radio is not stock but has been installed for about 4 years.  I noticed the radio has a lot of feedback and shorts out probably due to not being properly grounded.  I also noticed a wire to the power of the radio was torn recently (probably happened one day while cleaning the car and got the vacuum snagged on it, I have since disconnected the radio entirely but still have the battery problem, so this is probably not the problem).
Thx in advance,
Dan 
>>Fritz The Cat|||Followup-question||| Try starting the car and disconnecting the ground cable from the battery. Does the engine die? If it still runs, rev it up a bit, see if it dies. Post back with the results.

A road legal Toyota 3SGTTE powered Fraser Clubman ran 0-100-0 km/h (or 0-62-0 mph) in 6.6 seconds - 0-100 in 3.7 seconds 100-0 in 2.9 seconds in a comparison run by NZ Autocar Magazine in 2000 using Correvit timing equipment.
Something like 400hp and a 700kg (about 1550lbs) car equals serious power to weight and 3.7 seconds to 100 clicks is ZZR-1100 territory.  Oh yeah, it's rear wheel drive and runs on 15 inch treaded tyres too...  It's quicker on slicks...

Cycle your key from off to run 8 times within 10 seconds and ending in run. Your locks should lock and then unlock to enter programming mode.
Once this occurs, press any button on your transmitter and the locks will cycle letting you know that the transmitter has been programmed.
Do the same for the other remote.
Afterwards turn the key to the off position and the locks will cycle once more I believe.
That's it!!
You done it!!

Sorry, perhaps too honest there, But you realy need to get away from fords (Unless your paying less than £10 000 for it) They do make very good small practical car (Cheap car) But because nobody will pay anything over that for a ford! 
  - Yawn!

>>47ford|||Followup-question||| Check out my ford pick-up on   
I've got a list of what has been done (before I bought it), what I have done to it, and what I plan on doing to it. Unfortunatly it is a little older than what you are working with, but if I can get the stuff I need I figure you shouldn't have a problem with yours.  One of my favorite sources for ideas and suppliers is Streedrodder (it is a magazine with lots of good tech articles and ADS for aftermarket parts) and Classic Custom Trucks.  Mooneyes has great accessories (skull shift knobs for instance) as well as Billet Specialties, Colorado Custom (wheels and steering wheels), and Dakota Digital (just to name a few).

>>V8X|||Followup-question||| Hmmm,
So some people here don't like Ford's.  That's fine, everyone has their own taste.  Even if they have bad taste in vehicles.
TVR Tuscan Type R - Cheap, I don't think so.  You can purchase a stripped down model by any maker which makes it cheaper.  I think you want to be high class with your TVR, which could not hang with a Saleen SR.  The SR is not cheap and can out perform most exotic cars.  The TVR is basically a spin off of Ford, as previously stated.  Oh, they may no longer use Ford for their engines, but that is where they started.  All they've done is expand on to what Ford originated. 
Jimbo_Jones - Do you have an actually reason that Ford sucks? I think you are just scared that once you get behind the wheel of any Ford, you'll be hipnotized and will see the truth.  The truth that you've been missinformed all your life, and realize that you've been driving an imitation
Moppie -slow, fat and ugly.  Sounds to me like a Japanese or European car to me.  Why do you think Ford has the fastest car under $30K?  Why do you think that the Saleen SR can out run Ferrari's, NSX's, Porsche? Because you're comparing a sports car to a escort, not a good comparison of speed.  Fat, you should actually spell that Phat.  What one brand sells more cars in a year than any other?  Ford, why cause people want a reliable car, that will do it's job good and last!  Ugly, I guess it's all about the eye of the beholder.  I hate cars with the 4 foot spoiler, that the owner will never use in their life.  All it's there for is decoration.  Ugly or beautiful, your style won't help you any at passing that Ford in front of you!  
It's just funny how people make assumptions, without ever owning or driving a certain vehicle.  I like Fords, but don't go around bashing Chevy fans.  There are reasons everyone buys their car (style, cost, accesories, engine, etc...), but that's their opinion.  If anyone wants to compare specs from any given car, I'll show where a Ford/Lincoln/Mercury will hang with, or even trash it's competitor.  Why do you think Ford has more #1 selling vehicles than any other company? Cheap, nope you can get a Chevy, Dodge, Honda, Toyota or a Nissan for the same cost, if not less.  Reason is they are reliable, safe and perform their basic funtion very well.  If you had read any Consumer magazines, you would know this.  I hate to bother everyone, but I guess we'll let the blind continue to lead the blind!

>>Graphik Styles</span>|||Followup-question||| yea tru.....its just that i had heard taht like fords where really bad in the maintenance area........
thanx 
>>V8X|||Followup-question||| Fords, Chevy's, Honda's, Lexus, Range Rover, etc all have lemons.  There are some that are just bad from the assembly line.  From my experience, Ford is as reliable as any other in it's price range.  Look at the Focus, it has some problems but it is still the #1 selling compact car in the world.  The Chevy Cavalier and it's twin the Pontiac Sunfire have many more problems, a lower re-sell value and are considered less reliable than the Focus.  What is the #1 selling full size pickup for the last 26 years?  Ford F-Series.  What is the #1 selling SUV of all time?  Ford Explorer.  What is the #1 selling compact pickup for the last 18 years?  Ford Ranger.  What is the #1 selling compact SUV out right now?  Ford Escape.  Ford actually stands for &quot;First On Race Day&quot;.  You know Chevy's are like a rock, they just sit there.  I will admit that during the 80's, there were some bad cars.  But this was with all car companies, not just Ford.  I currently own 4 Fords (2 Explorer's, 2 Ranger's), and none of them have given me any big problems.  Just the usual changing of belts, filters, fluids, etc...  No major work.  Father has an 81 F150 &amp; 98 F150, and it's the same with no major problems.  Also, the matter of up keep is big with any vehicle.  If you treat it like S#*t, than it's going to turn into S#*t.  If you keep good care of your car, no matter what it is (unless it's a lemon), it will last longer and give you less problems.  So Fords won't give you any problems unless they're a lemon (any car company has these), or if you don't keep your car in good condition.
I would recommend you to read Consumer Reports.  This covers the new cars coming out, and compares them to their counter parts produced by other companies.  They don't just base their report on performance like some magazines.  They cover all aspects of the car/truck (safety, reliability, standard equipment, performance, cargo room, head room, etc...), and rate each by their catagory (compact, midsized, fullsized, etc...).  Some cars on their reports rate high, but are not recommended by them due to the history of the company that makes the car, and the history of that particular model.  I've usually seen Ford's rank between 1-4 on their reports, and they usually rate about 7-10 cars for each catagory (compact, mid, full, compact truck, etc...).  So I wouldn't say Fords are bad, it just depends on how the vehicle is treated.  Hope this helps you understand that some Chevy fan was plowwing smoke up your A$$ because their Chevy has never been as reliable in the long run as Ford's have.  I usually base all my information on the reliability that Consumer Reports states. Which I've never seen any Chevy rated higher than any Ford in any catagory.

>>>Title||| Tranny prob ?
>>kev_1669|||Original question||| My family owns a '94 E-350 Club Wagon 15 Passenger(1 of those church vans) We bought it becuz it was deal we couldn't pass up. 
351 Windsor 150,000 miles 4-speed auto on its second transmission 
When my dad drives it he drives it like a baby, to conserve gas. 
My mom would rather drive it than the new Saturn my dad just bought for the around town car. Before we got an old car for me to learn how to drive, we drove the van around town. So now my dad drives it to work......... 
In the last few months we have been having probs w/ the tranny. 
It will just slip in N for no reason going down the road @ 65 or any speed. It will slip and we can sit there and rev the engine and then it will jerk back in gear. It will also JERK into the next gear when shifting. Somtimes it does this and somtimes it will drive as good as new. 
Somtimes when it does it, we pop it in N and cut it off(while going down the road) for a few secs. and the restart it and it will drive good and sometimes it will start doing it again. 
We have already had it looked at twice. The tranny guy checked the fault codes that were in the computer and it had a rear end speed sensor fault in the computer, so we replaced the Sensor and it still did it, so then he dropped the tranny oil pan and it didn't have 1 sliver of metal in it. So now the guy told us it was either a new tranny or a new Computer. Both being $1500-2000. 
I told my dad that it was the computer from the begining, but we r not sure. My mom won't even drive it. I am not even allowed to drive it and my mom made me drive it the other day becuz she freaks out when it does it....LoL..... 
Anybody got any suggestions or any experiences? 
>>TerminalVelocity|||Followup-question||| well, the comp is a possabality...
have you checked the fluid levels once its really heated up?
and also, when the pan was droped, did your mechanic check the valve body for anything that could be out of place?  Hell, just too much dirt in the valve body can cause this because fluid wont make it to all the right places and provide pressure so it would simply fail and go to N.
In any case, ,good luck!

>>Lee Buckalew|||Original question||| I am looking for help in figuring out the original emmisions equipment provided with the 1973 Ford Ranchero.  I have the vin.# and all tag codes.  The engine is the 351 Cleveland, 2v.
I know that the vehicle has a PCV valve, a charcoal canister and one VSV.  I don't know if it had an air pump and I don't have an emmisions schematic that shows me how to connect the charcoal canister and the VSV.
Any help is greatly appreciated.
Thanks,
Lee 
>>TerminalVelocity|||Followup-question||| well...why are you smoging a 73?  Unless theres some place that requires all vehicles smoged, you shouldnt need to on a 73.  Emmisions equipment wasnt made big untill 74, thats when it was put into all vehicles.  That pvc should be all you have, the charcol chanaster suprises me as it is.  You sure its a 73? 
>>Lee Buckalew|||Answer||| Yes, it is a '73.  In Missouri all vehicles 1971 and newer require a test.  No idle test but it is a dyno test at various speeds.
The vehicle in question is a 1973 Ranchero, 351c 2V, .030 over (357 cu. in.).  Engine has been built but the remainder, except paint, is stock.  3.00 rear end, FMX trannie.
I have not tried to test a vehicle of this age in MO.  So I want to be prepared if they try to tell me it &quot;needs&quot; components that were'nt on it from the factory.
Thanks,
Lee 
>>TerminalVelocity|||Answer||| intresting, I thought here in CA we had the hardest laws.  Well to my knowlage no thhere wasnt an air pump (the smog pump).  There would be a mounting spot for it on the block, just like the alternator and power stearing pump.  If you have a 2bbl you shouldnt have a problem mostlikley unless they are really harsh on it. 
>>Lee Buckalew|||Answer||| Terminal Velocity,
Thanks for the input.  I had it smogged yesterday and it passed faster than anything else i've done.  In CA you guys have a start and idle test in addition to a rolling test on the dyno I believe.  Here in MO we just have a dyno test following various speeds and shift patterns.  What I found out yesterday, for anyone new to older vehicles (like me) and going through this in MO is that anything pre-1980 they just run at idle, test idle engine speed and sniff at idle.  No problem to pass unless your puking out smoke.
Once again, thanks Terminal Velocity.  I'll probably have other questions as I get this back into daily driver shape and beef up the 351c some (aussie heads, x-pipe, etc)
Lee 
>>TerminalVelocity|||Followup-question||| sure, anytime
If you need advice on a setup I can help ya out, and there are some here on AF who know tons especally here in the ford forum.
If you need anything else  is my mail
And here in ca, anything 74+ needs idle,  roling,  various load conditions, etc, so unless its perfect or newer, it fails.

I am a postgraduate student currently working on my Masters projects at university.
The objective of my project is to test the following hypothesis: 
'Telematics can contribute to increased passenger and fleet car sales for Ford UK within the next five years.'
Part of my research would involve looking at the attitude that drivers from different countries have towards telematics, with a particular focus on the attitudes of UK and US drivers. I would therefore be very grateful if you would be able to assist me with my research, by participating in the online survey. As a gesture of thanks for your contribution I plan to host the results of my online survey during October 2002. 
My online survey can be accessed via the following link: 
Please note that the survey would need to be accessed using an IE browser as some of the formattings don't work on netscape. You would also need to enter a unique reference ID for each page to identify your page submissions.

>>Rick Berg|||Original question||| Was looking to use a Dual over head cam engine out of a lincoln/ford for a hot rod.  Is it possible to eliminate the electronic intake and replace with a older style intake and carb.  Or possibly a kit that completes this conversion?  Thanks 
>>HillbilySailor|||Answer||| I don't know of any carb/intake setup for this engine, but Painless Wiring makes a retrofit wiring harness for this engine.  What this harness does is adapt all of the electronics and such into older vehicles, thereby eliminating having to use the factory wiring harness out of the donor car.  You will need to grab the computer out of the donor car though to make everything work.  Your on your own for a fuel system.  You'll have to retrofit the factory gas tank to accept a return line.  Your best bet is to buy a replacement gas tank and have it retrofitted to accept an in-tank fuel pump from a late model Mustang.  If memory serves, this fuel pump has the return line, or the return line is at it's base.  Hope this helps!

current modds beeing done, rebored to 2,74l that would be 4 mahle forged pistons of 91,93mm, planned deck, lightned rods and balaced cranck, O-ringed block, so the pel-pro gasket will take more than 160 bhp, the top is the 8 valve standard ohc, wich will have the kent rl 31 rally cam, adjutible vernier pully, ported inntake and exhaust ports, and i'm putting on the rally exhaust manifold 4-2-1 type with 2,5&quot; end, and 2,5&quot; freeflow exhaust.

>>HillbilySailor|||Followup-question||| You could also snag a turbo setup from a early 80's Mercury Capri.  The engine was a 2.3 liter 4 cyl.  I'm pretty certian the block is the same.  If it isn't. just yank the whole engine complete with turbo.  It should drop right in. 
>>Moppie</span>|||Answer||| The pinto's respond better to Turboing than anything else.
The most hp you can expect from one N/A is about 180-190. and thats with a fair degree of tuning.
Thier not really Fords greatest acievement in terms of engine design.
For simple bolt ons a set of side draft webbers and proper Header will make quite a noticable differnce.
But to really make the most of it you need to think about taking the head off and getting it proffesinaly ported, and finding a suitable cam to match.

I have two options, I can use a 302 or and old 300cid straight 6 from a truck... I would like to know what I will need to do (just basic stuff) to swap out my old 200cid. I am sure it will require some work as far as mounts &amp; frame... but not sure what.
Any info would be greatly appreciated.
~Brian 
>>Heep|||Answer||| I can't help you directly as I'm not familiar with these cars in detail, but I'd say the 302 would be a better option.  A V-8 is shorter front to back than a straight six, so it would most likely fit better.  Also, the 5.0L (302) was factory installed in some Fairmonts, so this tells us it will already fit with no real problems.  Engine swaps in older cars are usually fairly straight forward, but I can almost guarantee that you'll need a new tranny and wiring as well.  Best bet would be to find a junked 302 Fairmont in a junkyard and use parts from it.  
>>HillbilySailor|||Answer||| Keep away from that I-6!  lol  The 302 swap should be a slam dunk if you have the V-6.  If memory serves me correctly, the 302 and your V-6 share the same motor mounts.  You'll need to upgrade the front end to handle the extra weight (new springs and shocks for starters).  You'll also need a beefier tranny to handle the 302's power.  Also consider swapping out the rear end.  if you have the weak rear end I thnk you do, you' ll want to upgrade to the 8 inch out of a Mustang.  See my reply in your other post as a reference.

>>>Title||| T-bird seats
>>Old Ford fan|||Original question||| I just registered here, so I'm new to this forum.
Anyway, I'm redoing the interior in my '64 Fairlane, and for that purpose I bought a set of seats from a junk yard '94 Thenderbird to put in my car. My question is this: Does anyone know if the seatbacks on these buckets are supposed to lock? I've looked at a few sets of 89-97 body style T-bird seats, and NONE of the ones I've looked at locked (note that these were junked cars). I'm thinking that they're supposed to lock because there is a mechanism there and what looks like a relese lever; I really don't get this though, most newer coupes have bucket seats that lock upright, these you can flip forward just like my old split bench.
I hope somebody can answer this for me though, I think I could rig a spring on the mechanism that would make it lock, but how is it really supposed to be? I need to figure out what I'm going to do, I want them to lock, but I don't know anything about these mechanisms but what I can tell by looking at them.
Thanks for any info,
Will

Basically, the summary of it was that as of yet, there is no plans for production, however it's not the first concept that they have made in recent years. They've basically used the F-150 Lightning engine, but redone the heads to double the valve count. The figure on 6-8 psi of boost, and 500 hp. The designers have said that the car will have tremendous low end grunt, which is good news for all us non ricers. AND, for all those who are not big fans of vipers, they are designing the thing to whup it off the line. (As for handling, I'm betting the MK I could take it...) And for the older generation, they plan to keep it simple, no active differentials, electronic shocks, blah blah blah... they will however have a 6 speed.

>>Brokenbone|||Original question||| After engine is warmed up, our 2.3 liter '87 Ranger has intermittent problems of idle loss to the point of nearly shutting down altogether and then overcompensating to recover.  Normally, after throttling up to 1500-2000rpm or so, it will idle for 15 or 20 seconds then start the process again.  
After doing normal tuneup part replacements (i.e. plugs, wires, cap, rotor and fuel filters=there are 2), I spent over $100 on replacing O2, throttle position and EGR sensors but symptoms still occur.  Was advised to consider replacing the Mass Air Flow sensor but that part doesn't exist for the '87 model.  Was told the equivalent part is &quot;Idle Air Control Valve&quot; at approximately $80.
Anyone with similar engine specs have these kind of idle problems?
Was Idle Air Control Valve the solution or is there a better (hopefully more economical) answer?

>>Roadster2|||Original question||| Ford will begin production of an all new model in late 2003 that will compete with the Toyota Highlander, Honda Pilot and Chrysler Pacifica. The new vehicle, codenamed D219, is pictured here in early prototype form. While the sheetmetal and most other cosmetic touches are still under wraps, this photograph exposes the general direction Ford is going with the vehicle. 
      It has a profile reminiscent of a longer Lexus RX300 or Toyota Highlander. The interior package will include three rows of seating and ample room for passengers and cargo for families. 
      Production of the new vehicle will take place in Ford’s Chicago Assembly Plant, which will cease production of Taurus and Sable models before the D219 and its sister models enter production. A transversely mounted V6 engine mated to a CVT with optional all-wheel drive will power the D219.

The Shelby Cobra, all of the Vectors, as well as all the other vintage cars on this site. It was an actual production car, they had to make at least 100 for it to be in the GT class in the 60's. 
>>GoinRallyin|||Followup-question||| *ahem*
The GT40 in it's four incarnations - MkI, MkII, MkIII, and MkIV - was NEVER a production car. Furthermore, the GT40 was not to 'replace' the Shelby Cobra. The Shelby Cobra was a Ford-powered AC-built Shelby-named car. (Ford only provided the engines, they did NO assembly of the Shelby Cobra 427AC.) The GT40's sole purpose was as a competition car for endurance racing. For that matter, the GT40's were built in the UK unil the MkIV, which was the only American-built GT40. Incidentally, Dan Gurney and A.J. Foyt won LeMans in 67 in a MkIV. The MkII was the first 427, which finished 1-2-3 at LeMans in 66. 
Now, if you're a good Car and Driver reader, you'll already have this month's issue. (Feb02) Turn to page 34. If you don't have it, well, you're just going to have to wait a while. Let's just say if it happens, I don't doubt that we'll have a GT40 specific forum very soon.  
>>ac427cpe</span>|||Followup-question||| i thought that one of the requirements for racing in LeMans was that the car HAD to be a production car that could be bought at a dealership.  In fact i KNOW that you could buy one in a dealership because a friend of my dad's has one that he races.  I didn't was the replacement of the cobra, it was the American car that started to beat them.  It was actually a Lola prototype that Ford bought to beat Ferrari when they wouldn't sell out to Ford.  and i don't have that issue yet - sorry, i'll check it out at a grocery store or something.  and thanks, i didn't know that the MKIV was the only American built one. 
>>ac427cpe</span>|||Followup-question||| i did some research and found that there were 107 made, the ones that were sold as street cars sold for about $20,000 each... in the mid-60's!  they were made durring the time that Carroll Shelby was in charge of Ford racing.  they ran with the Shelby Daytona Coupe and when they were tuned (all the bugs were worked out) after a few years of trial, they were often the fastest cars on the course.
it was a MKII that Foyt and Gurney won LeMans with in '67 (the MKII X1, the only GT40 that was a convertable).  that was also the yeat that they had the 1-2-3 sweep, it was a 1-2-3-5 in '66

>>>Title||| Ford job cuts expected.
>>DVSNCYNIKL</span>|||Original question||| 
NEW YORK (CNN/Money) - Ford Motor Co. cut its dividend for the second time in a year and is expected to cut up to 20,000 jobs Friday in a widely anticipated restructuring plan meant to slash costs and boost profits at the No. 2 automaker.
Ford announced its dividend will be 10 cents a quarter on its widely-traded Class B stock, down from 15 cents recently and from 30 cents it paid a year ago.
The company also is expected to announce it will idle several assembly plants. The national contract with the United Auto Workers union does not permit outright plant closings before 2003.
Ford has been struggling with industry overcapacity, restrictive labor contracts and an industry incentive war that have attracted buyers but helped cause rising losses at the company Ford's involvement in the Firestone tire recall also has raised questions about quality.
The company could cut as many as 12,000 union jobs and 8,000 salaried positions, after big cuts were announced recently by General Motors Corp. (GM: Research, Estimates) and DaimlerChrysler (DCX: Research, Estimates).
In addition, a person familiar with the situation said CEO William Clay Ford will not take a salary this year.
A Ford spokesman declined to comment on job cuts, production cutbacks or this year's salary for Ford, great grandson of company founder Henry Ford.
Wall Street has been expecting a broad restructuring plan for weeks after Ford said it would unveil one this month. Ford has cut jobs and idled or slowed production at several plants in the interim as its profits continued to slide.
Ford already has ended matching contributions to its salaried staff's 401(k) retirement plans as well as increasing health insurance premiums.
Just my .02, although I'm not a Ford fan, I can't help but feel bad for the workers who have to suffer at the expense of big wigs who feel the need to cut corners at the expense of making a profit. 
>>DVSNCYNIKL</span>|||Answer||| Even more news.  This is actually more specific.
DETROIT (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co. (F.N) said on Friday it would cut 35,000 jobs worldwide -- 22,000 of them in North America -- and close three assembly plants in North America.
Ford Chief Operating Officer Nick Scheele said the world's second-largest automaker would close assembly plants in Edison, New Jersey; Hazelwood, Missouri; and Oakville, Ontario. The Canadian and New Jersey plants build pickups, while the Missouri plant builds the Ford Explorer sport utility vehicle.
Scheele also said Ford would close two parts plants in Cleveland, Ohio, and Dearborn, Michigan. In addition, 11 plants will undergo major restructuring, including shift cuts, with production cuts at nine additional plants.
The cuts come as part of an overhaul of the company aimed at improving profits by $9 billion by the middle of the decade. Ford said it would take an after-tax charge of about $4.1 billion in the fourth quarter of 2001 in the restructuring drive.
It said it would cut North American production capacity by 16 percent, to 4.8 million vehicles from 5.7 million vehicles,

It's too bad to see the Cougar be dropped it was a very sweet looking car.
DEARBORN, Mich., Jan. 11 – Ford Motor Company [NYSE:F] today announced several restructuring actions as part of its Ford Revitalization Plan, a product-focused program designed to strengthen its position in the marketplace and improve its financial results. These actions will enhance the company’s ability to produce the highest level of quality cars and trucks while reducing the cost structure. 
&quot;Our revitalization plan is based on executing the fundamentals of our business to build great products,&quot; said Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Bill Ford. &quot;What we are outlining today is a comprehensive plan that builds for the future. It's going to take everyone in the extended Ford family – employees, suppliers and dealers – working together, over time, to make it work.&quot;
The actions announced today include: 
New products: A product-led revitalization program which will lead to the introduction of 20 new or freshened products in the U.S. annually between now and mid-decade. 
Plant capacity: Reduction of North American plant manufacturing operating capacity by about one million units by mid-decade to realign capacity with market conditions. 
Hourly workforce: About 12,000 hourly employees in North America are affected by the actions completed in December or to be taken throughout 2002 and beyond. An additional 3,000 hourly employees were affected in 2001. Plans are being made to reassign as many plant employees as possible. 
Salaried workforce: Last year's voluntary separation program for salaried employees and other related actions resulted in a 3,500-person workforce reduction in North America. This program will be extended to achieve an additional 1,500-person salaried workforce reduction to reach the goal of 5,000. If necessary to meet this goal, an involuntary separation program will be used. 
Global workforce: About 35,000 employees will be or already have been affected by combined actions around the world since January 2001. These include 21,500 in North America -- 15,000 hourly, 5,000 salaried and 1,500 agency employees -- and 13,500 in the rest of the world. 
Material costs: A material cost-reduction program has been initiated with North American suppliers which shares design savings, with Ford receiving 65 percent of implemented cost reductions and suppliers receiving 35 percent in the first year. Designs will be developed that will help improve Ford's products and overall quality. This program, along with other material cost reduction efforts, is expected to improve ongoing annual profits before taxes by $3 billion by mid-decade. 
Discontinued low-margins models: The Mercury Cougar, Mercury Villager, Lincoln Continental and Ford Escort will be discontinued this year. 
Beyond North America: Revitalization plans beyond North American automotive operations include the continued implementation of the European Transformation Strategy, the Premier Automotive Group strategy, the turnaround in South America and a revised direction for Ford Financial. 
Divestitures: Ford is pursuing the sale of non-core assets and businesses. Ford’s plans include $1 billion of cash realization from these actions in 2002. 
Dividend: The annual common stock and Class B stock dividend will be reduced from 60 cents a share to 40 cents.
These actions and those already taken are expected to improve pre-tax operating results to $7 billion annually, an improvement of $9 billion by the middle of the decade. As part of the restructuring, the company will take an after-tax charge to fourth quarter earnings of $4.1 billion. The charge will cover several items, including asset impairments and personnel costs.
Today's announcement is part of an ongoing series of steps the company has taken over the past few months and will take in the future to restructure its business. Those taken earlier include the consolidation of car and truck product development in North America, a 50 percent dividend reduction, a 7 percent pay reduction to contract labor firms, a voluntary separation program for North American salaried employees, the elimination of bonuses and raises for senior managers, a sharing of health care costs with U.S. salaried employees and retirees, and the elimination of the company match for U.S. salaried employee 401(k) plans.
&quot;Although the actions we're outlining today are difficult, they are necessary steps to lead Ford back to a strong financial and competitive position,&quot; said Nick Scheele, president and chief operating officer. &quot;They will help us to address our problems, while at the same time permitting us to keep a sharp focus on delivering great products. Quality and value will be the hallmarks of our cars and trucks.&quot;
PLANT ACTIONS
Manufacturing plans over the next several years include: 1) Closing five plants: Edison Assembly, Ontario Truck Plant, St. Louis Assembly, Cleveland Aluminum Casting and Vulcan Forge; 2) No new products have been identified for two plants: Ohio Assembly and Cuautitlan Assembly, 3) Pursuing the sale of Woodhaven Forging Plant, 4) Major downsizing and shift reductions at 11 plants; and 5) Line speed reductions and changes to operating patterns at nine plants. 
&quot;In order to remain competitive and profitable, we must make some hard decisions to align capacity with our anticipated sales,&quot; said Scheele. &quot;At the same time, the company is continuing its commitment to North American manufacturing operations with investments of about $20 billion over the next five years in new product programs and spending to add flexibility and increase our ability to respond quickly to changes in market demand.&quot;
FINANCIAL MILESTONES
In addition, the company today announced the following 2002 financial milestones:
Restructuring Priorities Milestones 
Communicate/implement plans Report on progress 
Quality (U.S.) Improve J.D. Power Initial Quality Survey 
Capacity utilization (North America) Improve by 10 percent 
Non-product related cost Reduce by $2 billion 
Divest non-core operations $1 billion cash realization 
Financial Results Milestones 
Pre-tax operating earnings Positive 
Capital spending $7 billion 
Europe Improve results 
South America Improve results 
&quot;We are confident we can achieve these goals through the efforts of our dedicated employee team,&quot; Bill Ford said. &quot;We know we have immediate challenges to face. It will be difficult, and in some cases, painful to turn things around. But we will turn things around.&quot;
Final results of the 2001 milestones will be announced when Ford releases its fourth quarter and full-year 2001 financial results on Jan. 17.
Ford Motor Company is the world's second largest automaker, selling vehicles in 200 markets and with approximately 345,000 employees on six continents.

>>Roadster2|||Answer||| As the calendar ticks over into 2002, the Ford F-Series pickup will celebrate its 25th anniversary as America's best-selling truck, and its 20th anniversary as America's best-selling vehicle — car or truck — according to a Ford press release.
Although the final 2001 sales results will not be released until Jan. 3, the gap between Ford F-Series and the next best-selling vehicle is equivalent to three months of sales, the statement said.
&quot;This is an unprecedented milestone,&quot; said Jim O'Connor, Ford Division president. &quot;F-Series is the foundation of the Ford franchise. Celebrating its silver anniversary of sales leadership is a testament to our Built Ford Tough truck heritage.&quot;
Through November, Ford dealers delivered 827,319 F-Series trucks to U.S. customers, an increase of 1.6 percent compared with the same period a year ago. Last year, Ford F-Series set an all-time calendar-year truck sales record of 876,716.
Ford's F-Series lineup includes F-150, Harley-Davidson F-150, King Ranch F-150, F-150 SuperCrew, F-150 SVT Lightning, and F-Series Super Duty.
Ford added that its Ford Division has been America's best-selling automotive brand for 15 years running, and is the best-selling individual brand of cars, pickups, sport utility vehicles, and vans, including the following best-selling nameplates:
Mustang: America's best-selling small specialty car for 16 years. 
Ranger: America's best-selling compact pickup 15 years. 
F-Series: America's best-selling pickup for 25 years, best-selling vehicle for 20 years. 
E-Series: America's best-selling full-size van for 23 years 
Explorer: America's best-selling SUV for 11 years. 
Escape: America's best-selling small SUV in its first full year of sales.

>>>Title||| Not Building the Forty-Nine and Fairlane
>>Roadster2|||Original question||| as what  says
FORTY-NINE, FAIRLANE DEAD?
USA Today reports that Ford’s slumping finances have left no money to produce an updated Ford Fairlane and a roadgoing version of the concept Forty-Nine. The Fairlane, the paper reports, was to eventually replace the Crown Victoria. The cost pressures also mean it’s virtually certain that the Ford mid-engine supercar to be shown at next month’s Detroit auto show won’t be produced as well. While Ford is in its current product drought, analysts like John Casesa at Merrill Lynch are predicting that the competition will replace its products much more aggressively, which could place Ford in even a more difficult position. 
>>Roadster2|||Answer||| here was info about the fairlane at first
2004 Ford Fairlane 
In a secret project that Ford has kept tight wraps on for the past two years, a new rear-wheel-drive car is being developed that will fit into the full-size sedan market just above the Taurus but below the evergreen Crown Victoria. And the car is going to carry a name rich in Ford heritage: Fairlane. The hush-hush Fairlane project will produce a new vehicle by the model year 2004. Look for this car to offer both V6 and V8 engine power with a special version of the V8 aimed straight at the 60,000-unit-sales-a-year police cruiser market
