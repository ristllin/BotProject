>>>Title||| need ideas on my 68 mustang project car
>>ginhotrod99|||Original question||| Hello im new here about two years ago my old man passed giving me possession of our mustang he had it build for me when I was very little about 7 currently it sat for about 10 years in a garage till he gave it to me to take care of a 4.7 liter v8 about 400 hp its very high in torque it has a c4 3 speed auto that's rebuilt but is pretty banged up from abuse :C It has a holley 2 barrel carb it was very slightly oil starved but had it looked just lost some life in my heads :C suspension too soft bottoms out now I want to learn form people and get ideas on what I should do with her she is a very hot tempered car over heats way too quick run at about 230 to 200 mostly had a thermostat changed and she run now at 190 to 180 on mild hot days scorching at around 230 to 240 she shuts down and refuses to start for about and 1 hour after cooling here is her pictures someone show me how to post pictures? 
>>65comet|||Followup-question||| To post a picture you have to save it to a free picture sharing site then post the link.  I think there is another way, but I haven't done it here in years and can't remember.
If it is the original radiator, or even the second, you have to replace it.  The original just wasn't designed to last this long or for better cooling.  My 65 Comet when it went from a 260 to a 289, the overheating back in 1979 was horrendous and it needed a new one.  I can't give you advice on the suspension. 
>>piston_slap|||Followup-question||| 400HP in a 289 with a 2 bbl carb? Not very likely but you'll need to get the coolant temps down and the radiator replacement that 65Comet is where I'd start too. Rock Auto has a selection of radiators from $105 to $250. Even have a 2 row aluminum for $126 
>>>Title||| Should I Rebuild Carb or get a Fitech EFI system?
>>gz19960101|||Original question||| Hello Everyone, 
  Thanks for check my post. 
  I have a 79 Thunderbird with orginal carb on a 5.0 Ford 302 engine which produce about 130hp, which I am going to rebuild the engine to gain some hp about 220+. But for the carb part, I am enough about those old school stuff that need to adjust every week, or either they will have a insane idle speed about 2000+ when hot, and sometimes almost die at 200-300 when stop at red light. 
  So my  first question, a rebuild on this carb will help me to address those concern? Like high idle, hard cold start, bad smell when morning, bad fuel mileage? Because a rebuild and installation will cost about $300. And also, what about switch to other brand like holley etc.
  And my second question, There are so many aftermarket EFI producer in the market, like FItech, EZ EFI etc, As for my low hp engine about 200hp, I dont think i need a really expensive  EFI  system, which I think i will only need to get a fitech go street 400hp, which I think will be enough for this engine, and it only cost 800. And a new 4 manifold will be 300, and fuel pump etc, which will total cost about 1200-1400, and to consider there are tons of conversion video online, may be i can do it my own, or i need to plus another couple hundred for labor. 
  
  My concern on those EFI system, are they realible? Like for at least 2-3 years i dont need to often adjust or fix them? 
Any ideas? Thanks!!!! 
>>347 ranger|||Answer||| Ford 's old  two barrel carbs  left  a lot to be  desired. a 4 barrel intake manifold and a 
electronic EFI would  be an up grade that  would be worth while!

>>Blue Bowtie</span>|||Answer||| Ford Is Killing Off All But 2 Car Models 
>>Stealthee</span>|||Original question||| My opinion is people are tired of ugly cars. Ford is seeing a dip in car sales because they dont know how to make a good looking car. Same is true for GM where they cut a bunch of jobs at Lordstown where they produce the Cruze. 
>>65comet|||Followup-question||| Ford man since the day I was born, but other than a Mustang (which they are still going to make) there hasn't been a car I would buy in years.  I'll probably get a new Expedition to replace the old one next. 
>>Mikelangeloford|||Answer||| Ford isn't selling cars for the same reason as Chrysler. Overpriced and under engineered trash. Go to any Pick and Pull the vast majority of their cars are Ford, Dodge, Chrysler and Chevy cars and trucks that didn't last 10 years on the road. People are not going into debt for 7 years on a car that lasts 5. No one is going to miss an underpowered mess with cheap material and cheap seats that cost $25,000. Car companies need to up their game and produce quality, easy to maintain, affordable cars.

>>tomj76|||Answer||| My take it this... I don't see the practical value in owning an SUV or Crossover.  I looked at the Explorer before I purchased my Windstar, but since it only carried five people AND didn't even hold one full sheet of plywood, plus the higher operating costs (due to fuel consumption and tire size, etc.), I saw no value for me to own one.  I haven't looked that much at the Crossovers, but the same logic seems to apply.
I don't see much value in a pickup truck (for me) because I only occasionally need the ability to carry the payload, but more often would like to carry passengers, and they also cost a lot more to operate unless you purchase a small truck.
Add to all this that my experience with purchasing new vehicles from the dealership has not been great, with several defects (not long term wear) in the vehicles that I've purchased.  The only reason I've remained a customer is that I've found that once _I_ fix the problems, the vehicles have been a good value.
I've decided that my needs are best served by a sedan, a wagon, or a minivan.  Since Ford will not be making those products, I will most likely not purchase another (new) Ford unless something changes. 
>>dbegley|||Followup-question||| I was talking to my Ford Sales guy when I purchased my 17 Mustang GT and asked him that question. What is up with Ford making this decision. He said that Ford is not selling enough of those cars to justify being in that business. He added that the Toyota Camry is the best selling car in the US and they don't also don't make enough profit on the sales of that line to justify staying in it. People are buying SUV's and trucks. You do know the BEST selling vehicle in the world is the Ford F-150.

>>>Title||| 2.3 pinto fuel pump
>>resturt|||Original question||| The original pump was replaced and shortly it dripped oil from the bottom. It started as a drop but now it is a lot worse. I plan to put a new one on. The gas always drains down  after sitting a short while. Does a check valve help that problem? Would a check valve also have to be put into the return line? 
>>65comet|||Answer||| I haven't worked on a Pinto in over 35 years, but I don't remember them having a return line.  A bad seal in the pump will cause that oil leak.  Best to go with a new one.  I'd wait on a check valve till after the new pump since a good pump will act as a check valve. 
>>resturt|||Followup-question||| Thank you for the info. I plan to put a new pump on and see what happens.

>>>Title||| Need Help ASAP - Mechanics please
>>Valerie0146|||Original question||| Hello, I was driving my 2009 Ford Flex to the mall on Christmas Eve when it felt like my car was pulling a bit when I was driving. If I took my foot off the gas, it would stop by itself without any use of the breaks. Also, I could smell burning when I stopped.  I got to the mall and made sure the e brake wasn’t on so it wasn’t that. I called my brother in law who knows a lot about cars and he said it sounded like one of my calipers had seized. I brought the car to a shop
Today and told them what happened and they told me
That while they were checking they noticed two different fluids in my brake reservoir and said that all 4 of my wheels were seized. Which honestly didn’t make sense to me because I DROVE my car to them and the wheels were turning. Definitely having troubles but not totally seized. There was a strong burning smell by the time I got there I might add. They asked me if I could have added oil to my brake reservoir but it’s not possible. I may be a chick but I can read labels and the only fluids I topped up recently was my washer fluid and my power steering fluid because I have a slight leak but those reservoirs are both on the opposite side of the engine and I have topped them up several times so I know where the fluids are supposed to go. Now they are telling me they are going to have to fix the entire system and quoting me at $3500 to $4000...... I feel like I’m being taken advantage of and I don’t have that kind of money. A lot of other forums I have read the people say that if oil was in the brake reservoir it would make the brake system mush and not seize it up. Can this be something else?? I might also ad that my traction control and abs light comes on and off randomly for the last few months and I was told it was just the sensor. Any insight would seriously help me I just moved to the area from 3 hours away so finding a mechanic I can trust seems really hard.

>>65comet|||Followup-question||| Complete flush of the system, a new caliper if one is needed, all new pads at a quality expensive shop, I would expect to be around $500.  Use the internet to see what customers say about the other shops in the area and try one of them.
ABS sensor problems need to be tracked when the light is on usually.  I have had Fords with a cracked sensor that would trigger the light when water got inside and go off when they would dry out.  The big problem was having it stay tripped until I got a reading to find out which one it was. 
>>Sedanman64|||Followup-question||| If you're still having this problem, have you gotten out of the car and put your hand over each wheel while the problem is happening to see if one is much warmer than the other? I don't know much about late models and what all of the other system components are, but that sounds like a high quote. If one caliper is locking up, replace that one. You'll have to replace the pads on that end of the car, both sides, to make things even, and probably have those two rotors resurfaced and maybe new brake fluid but that should be it. 
Nice Comet, '65Comet! I had early Falcons for years. 
>>>Title||| Converting Ford part #'s to aftermarket
>>Sedanman64|||Original question||| Any tips on how to do this? Someone on another forum told me they did it, but haven't told me how. Obsolete Ford dealer part # is F1CZ78247A. Part is a Manual Lever Position Sensor for an automatic overdrive (transverse, not a regular AOD) in a 1994 1.9L Escort. 
Listings for this part on Ebay are confusing since I don't know if the part number matches what I'm looking for, and I don't know the name/designation for this transmission. See my &quot;bad neutral safety switch&quot; thread in the Escort section for more details if you like. Any help would be greatly appreciated as my car is waiting at the shop for this part, and they haven't been able to find one so now it's my job. Thanks!

>>65comet|||Answer||| Usually something wrong with the charging system (bad battery or bad alternator) will cause the computer to receive voltage that is too low and it will start giving off all kinds of weird codes.

>>>Title||| Need some advice
>>GeneralESpeaking|||Original question||| Hi everyone. So I work at the auto center at Walmart and I was tasked with transferring an old tire to a spare rim for a Ford. However, while taking the tire off the old rim a little bit of the rubber on the bead got shaved off. I still continued to put it on the spare rim though and now the customer has that tire as their spare. I just need some advice on whether this was a terrible decision or not. If they use that tire is there a possibility of a blowout occurring? Or will it just lose air? I'm thinking that if anything I can try to contact the customer and get them to come back to the shop. My job might be fucked, but I really don't want anyone getting hurt because of me. What do you guys think? 
>>65comet|||Followup-question||| It depends on the size/amount of rubber that was lost and if it included any of the belt material.  If there was no belt lost, it shouldn't fail.  But it will probably leak over time and the customer will have a flat spare when they need a full one.  If you think about someone late at night with a flat on the side of the road in a place without cell service, you wouldn't want to be responsible for them to not have a good spare. 
>>>Title||| 1973 Ford Gran Torino 5.8L 351W
>>Bumbadawg|||Original question||| Hey all,
My name is Joe and I had a few questions about my Gran Torino but didn't see a sub thread for the make. 
So, I have an automatic 1973 Gran Torino. The previous owner repainted it, cut the lower dash to fit a cd player, and put a crappy random steering wheel on it. But I have questions as a newb into diy. 
Let me begin!
1) Can this be modified to a higher amp one-wire alt. I tried before and burned up the wiring harness to the solenoid. Oops. So, can it be done? Cuz 60 amps suck. 
2) I love the original dash but because he cut it to fit a cd player (id go with original radio)--I either need to find the lower replacement, which I cannot find or have a custom dash made to go digital? 
3) It has parts for factory ac but didnt come with it. Any ideas on what id need to get it going?
4) The right side vents squeal like hell when defrost or vents are turned on. Blower motor? Any thoughts?
I know I have asked a ton...but aside from a vague Chilton book...I have nothing and few if any shops in my area will touch it cuz of its age. 
Thanks,
Joe B from NC 
>>65comet|||Answer||| 1.  The wiring isn't rated for higher, so you'd have to put in higher gauge wire to compensate.
2.  '73 wasn't a particularly popular year for Torino.  Finding a replacement dash isn't something I'd want to go after.  I'd probably weld in a patch panel.
3.  The original AC from most '73 would work, but also hard to find.  I'd go with one of those new kits they have for classic cars.  It will be reliable and have replacement/service parts available.
4.  Many a pen/pencil/toy was dropped down the big defrost vents on those cars and caused a fan squeal or two.  I'd open it up and see if it is a foreign object or the blower worn out. 
>>Bumbadawg|||Followup-question||| Wow, thanks for the info and quick response!
Ill look into the higher gauge wiring. Ill also check the blower to see. 
I appreciate all the info. The dash solution isn't ideal but..I understand what you mean about availability or lack thereof of replacement dash options. 
Really appreciate the info.

Don't know what it can be. It's been doing this for awhile now. I did some research but came up with transmission filter is loose and slides and cause it to miss and shut down while reversing. But honestly I don't wanna even mess with the transmission. Lol Any idea what it can be?

>>Jk350582016|||Original question||| I have a 1991 f-150 long bed, I believe the fuel pump went out in it. Was wondering how much would a local shop cost in total to replace it labor included. 
>>jasongraygits|||Answer||| It will cost you around $90-95 without labor and $115-120 with labor. 
>>Stealthee</span>|||Answer||| You may be quoting Dubai labor rates, but I can assure you that in the US labor will be more than that.  We did a pump on a similar year F150 a few years back and dropped the tank to do it.  Wasn't fun.  A shop may lift the bed off, but that wasn't an option for us due to space constraints and fear of snapping mount bolts.
Expect to pay a few hours labor for a shop to do it.  Most shops are probably going to charge $60-$80 an hour.  I'd say labor will be in the realm of $200, plus the cost of the pump.  If you have hand tools and time I'd recommend taking a day and doing it yourself. 
>>Jk350582016|||Answer||| I ended up doing it myself. I cut a access panel through the bed. I only paid for the fuel pump etc. Only took a few hours.

Hi everyone. Just did a search on this forum for &quot;lightweighting&quot; and the most recent post was this one in 2014 about the 2600 pound lightweight concept car from Ford.
Does anyone have any thoughts on lightweighting in 2017? What's the lightest car you've test-driven lately? Which cars or manufacturers stand out in this aspect? Is safety (as discussed in the comments above) still the biggest challenge?
We're going to be talking about lightweighting at our Knoxville forum next month, so thought we would get some input and crowdsource some thoughts. 
>>JEC Composites|||Followup-question||| Hello all,
Yamaha debuted their super lightweight concept car at the Tokyo Motor Show this year:
&quot;The concept car itself is a small, mid-engined two seater with an unmistakable profile and curves from the front to the rear. Weighing in at only 750kg (about 1,650 pounds), it is not hard to see where Yamaha got their inspiration from (hint: their motorcycles!).&quot;
This article includes the quote, &quot;Light weighting is the final frontier in the automotive industry.&quot;
Interesting as we'll be talking a lot about light weighting at our automotive composites forum this month, Nov 15-16 in Knoxville.
It will be exciting to see the sleek, lightweight cars to come!

>>gotdurt|||Original question||| I have a 2001 E150 van with a &quot;Ford Vehicle Security System&quot;. I've owned it for a few months, and haven't had a need to even think about the alarm; it never caused any problems with entry, starting, etc. I questioned that it even worked, which to me, was a good thing. 
A few days ago, I replaced the clockspring in the steering wheel, and to do so, had to disconnect the battery... after reconnecting the battery, all heck broke loose, and has been a headache ever since. I can't seem to find a rhyme or reason to how this thing works, but now any time I open a door with a key, it goes off. After disarming, which is almost every time I get in it, it won't start; I have to turn the key off, hit the unlock button on the fob a couple of times, then try again. Among other annoyances...
I have located the sensor and module. I also noted a wire that was tapped into a blue or purple (color blind) wire on the clock spring harness. I transferred it to the new wire, but question the need for it.
Frankly, there is no need for an alarm in this van, and I just want the alarm out of my life, or at least seemingly inoperable, like it was before... 
How can I:
a) disconnect it from the door locks AND ignition (ignition at the very least)
or:
b) remove it permanently, while keeping the remote keyless entry
